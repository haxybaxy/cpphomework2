What is Logic?
Nothing is more natural to conversation than
argument. We try to convince the person we
are arguing with that we are right, that our
conclusion follows from something that they will
accept. It would be no good if we could not tell
when one thing followed from another. What is
often passed off in conversation as an argument
does not fit the bill.
ALL PROPERTY
IS THEFT.
SO ALL THEFT
IS PROPERTY.

THEREFORE
THESE PEARLS
ARE MINE.

This is clearly rubbish because there is nothing
to link the truth of the conclusion to the truth of
the supporting claims. What we need is to
ensure that the truth of the supporting claims is
preserved by the argument. Logic is quite simply
the study of truth-preserving arguments.

Studying Sentences
The Greek philosopher Aristotle (384–322 BC) first gave us the
idea of a tool (organon) to argue convincingly. This study
included grammar, rhetoric and a theory of interpretation, as well
as logic. The first thing Aristotle does is discuss sentences.

SENTENCES COME IN
THREE TYPES ...

1. Singular:

Socrates is a man.

2. Universal: Every man is mortal.
3. Particular: Some men are mortal.

IN EACH OF THESE
TYPES WE ARE SAYING THAT
SOMETHING OR SOME THINGS
ARE OF A CERTAIN KIND.

The objects we talk about
(e.g., nouns like Socrates and
tables; abstract nouns like
walking; and pronouns like
someone and everyone) Aristotle
calls the subject of the sentence.
What we say about the subject of
the sentence (e.g., verbs like is
eating and has fallen; adjectives
like is difficult; and nouns like man
in things like “Socrates is a man”)
Aristotle called the predicate.
4

The Square of
Oppositions
Aristotle noticed that the truth of
some subject-predicate sentences
has an effect on the truth of other
subject-predicate sentences.

THE FOLLOWING
SENTENCES STAND IN
DEFINITE RELATIONS TO
EACH OTHER.
I CALL THIS MY SQUARE
OF OPPOSITIONS.

Sentences 1 and 2 cannot both be true.
The diagonal statements 1 and 4 are known as contradictories.
As long as there are men, one of them has to be true but never
both – the truth of one guarantees that the other is false.
The same is true for diagonal statements 2 and 3.
Sentences 1 and 3 cannot both be false but can both be true.
If 1 is true then so is 3, but not the other way around.
Similarly with 2 and 4. The same relation holds between “All men
are mortal” and “Socrates is mortal”.

5

The Syllogism
Using the square of oppositions, Aristotle noticed
a mysterious fact. Take a sentence like “Socrates
is a man”. If an argument of three statements is
built where the subject of the first statement is the
predicate of the second (call these the premises)
and the third statement is composed of the
remaining terms (call this the conclusion), then
the truth of the conclusion is guaranteed by the
truth of the premises.

THIS SCHEMA
I CALL A SYLLOGISM. WE CAN USE
IT TO SEE WHY ONE ARGUMENT IS
TRUE AND ANOTHER FALSE.

1. All men are mortal.
2. Socrates is a man.
3. Socrates is mortal.

V

I
L
A

1. All carnivores eat meat.
2. Some birds are not carnivores.
3. Some birds don’t eat meat.

1. I support Arsenal.
2. Bergkamp plays for Arsenal.
3. Arsenal will win the cup.

V

D

I
L
A

Aristotle forgot conditional statements that have
more than one predicate, e.g.,
“If Socrates is a man, then Socrates is mortal”.
6

We now have two reasons why the argument “Bergkamp plays
for Arsenal, therefore Arsenal will win the cup” is false. The first
comes from what is actually said. There is no way that the facts
that I support Arsenal and that Bergkamp plays for Arsenal are
enough to guarantee that Arsenal will win the cup. But there is
also the formal reason that the predicate of the first premise is
not the subject of the second.

YES, BUT THIS
IS VALID ...

1. If I support Arsenal, then
they will win the cup.
2. I do support Arsenal, so ...
3. Arsenal will win the cup.

IT IS STILL FALSE
BECAUSE VALIDITY ONLY
GUARANTEES THE TRUTH OF THE
CONCLUSION IF THE PREMISES ARE
TRUE. IN YOUR EXAMPLE THE
PREMISES ARE FALSE SO THE
CONCLUSION REMAINS
FALSE.

SO WHAT
GOOD DOES THIS
FORMALIZATION
DO US?

YOU’LL SEE.

Connective Logic
About a hundred years later, Chrysippus
of Soli (c.280–c.206 BC) changed the
focus of logic from single subjectpredicate statements to
complex statements
such as: “Socrates is a
man and Zeno is a
man.” This was a
major achievement. It
was said, “If the
gods used logic, it
would be the logic of
Chrysippus”. As we shall see,
the same is true of us humans,
but it took us a couple of
millennia to catch on.

WITH WORDS LIKE
“AND”, “OR” AND “IF…THEN…”,
DIFFERENT STATEMENTS CAN BE
JOINED TOGETHER AND THE
TRUTH OF THE WHOLE WILL
DEPEND EXCLUSIVELY ON
THE TRUTH OF THE
PARTS.

Each of these connectives has
a unique way of combining the
truth of the parts into the truth of
the whole.

8

For example the “or” connective and
only the “or” connective can be used
in the following way.

Either Muhammad will
go
to the mountain
or
the mountain will go to
Muhammad.
Muhammad did not go
to the
mountain, therefore the
mountain went to Muha
mmad.

USING MY
DEFINITIONS FOR
CONNECTIVES, I CAN SHOW
HOW TO DERIVE VARIOUS
STATEMENTS WHOSE TRUTH IS
ALWAYS GUARANTEED BY THE
TRUTH OF THE INITIAL
STATEMENT.

Chrysippus had no real
impact on the history of
logic for at least the next
1,500 years, not least
because his writings were
lost and his ideas known
only by second-hand
reports, but also because
Aristotle became the darling
of the Catholic Church.

9

Leibniz’s Law
For the next 2,000 years, logicians came up with an ever
increasing number of syllogisms, some including more than two
premises. The logician was a kind of alchemist playing around
with concepts to get valid arguments. Eventually, a method in
this madness was provided by Gottfried Leibniz (1646–1716).
Leibniz came up with the idea of treating statements like
equations in algebra. Equations use the equality sign “=” to say
that two sides must have the same numerical value,
e.g.,

x2 + y2 = z2

Leibniz introduced the equality sign in logic to show that “a” is
identical with “b”.
IF YOU CAN SAY
EXACTLY THE SAME OF
TWO THINGS, THEN THEY
ARE IDENTICAL.

TWO THINGS ARE
IDENTICAL IF
EVERYTHING THAT CAN BE
SAID OF THE ONE CAN BE
SAID OF THE OTHER.

a =b
This has been known
ever since as Leibniz’s
Law. He analysed it into
two inseparable claims,
“a is b” and “b is a”,
which he took to mean
that “all a’s are b’s” and
“all b’s are a’s”,
e.g., “All bachelors are
unmarried men and all
unmarried men are
bachelors.”
10

Clearly if a is identical with b, then we can replace the symbol
“a” in any statement with the symbol “b”, whilst preserving the
truth value of the statement. For example: “Socrates is an
unmarried man, an unmarried man is the same as a bachelor, so
Socrates is a bachelor.”
This is important because it allows us to assess the truth value of
a potentially infinite number of sentences using a manageable
number of steps. Leibniz had four.
1. “a = a”
e.g., “Socrates is Socrates.”
2. If “a is b” and “b is c” then “a is c”
e.g., “All men are mortal, Socrates is a
man, therefore Socrates is mortal.”
Saying “a is b” is the same as saying
that “all a’s are b”.
SO THIS HAS
EXACTLY THE SAME
FORM AS MY FIRST
SYLLOGISM!

AH, BUT THERE ARE
STEPS 3 AND 4 ...

3. “a = not (not a)”
e.g., “If Socrates is mortal then Socrates is not immortal.”
4. “ ‘a is b’ = ‘not-b is not-a’”
e.g., “Socrates is a man means that if you are not a man then
you are not Socrates.”
From these simple laws, Leibniz could prove every possible
syllogism. Instead of Aristotle’s square of oppositions, Leibniz
came up with the first real truth theory – deriving conclusions
from pre-established laws by substituting identical symbols
(synonyms) with each other.

11

The Reductio ad Absurdum
Leibniz’s preferred method of proof is an immensely important
tool much loved by logicians and philosophers ever since. He
called it reductio ad absurdum.
The “reductio” is a very simple yet fantastically powerful tool.
It has been used extensively since Leibniz invented it. It is well
illustrated by example.

SO, WHERE WERE
YOU ON THE NIGHT OF
THE 25TH?

I DIDN’T DO

SO WHAT?

12

In the reductio method
we assume a statement
to be true and see what
conclusions we can
draw from it. If, when drawing these conclusions, we get a
contradiction, we know that the
initial statement is false, because
contradictions are always false.

SOME PEOPLE DON’T
LIKE MY WONDERFUL NEW
METHOD BECAUSE IT ASSUMES THAT
EVERY SENTENCE IS EITHER TRUE OR
FALSE, AND OFFERS NO SUPPORT
FOR THIS ASSUMPTION.

truefalse
The great advantage of the
reductio method is that it allows
us to tell if a statement is true,
even if we do not know how to
construct a proof for it. We can
tell a statement is true by
showing that its negation leads to
a contradiction.

A “New Organon”
“For my invention used reason in its entirety and is, in
addition, a judge of controversy, an interpreter of notions,
a balance of probabilities, a compass which will guide us
over the ocean of experiences, an inventory of things, a
table of thoughts, a microscope for scrutinising things, a
telescope for predicting distant things, a general calculus,
an innocent magic, a non-chimerical cabal, a script which
all will read in their own language and which will lead the
way for the true religion everywhere it goes.”
Letter from Leibniz to the Duke of Hanover, 1679

THIS IS A REVOLUTION.
ARISTOTLE’S OLD ORGANON IS
DEAD, INSTEAD I GIVE YOU A “NEW
ORGANON”. IT IS A NEW WAY OF
THINKING ABOUT THE WORLD
AND ABOUT LOGIC.

LOGIC IS NO
LONGER A TOOL FOR
CONVINCING ARGUMENTS BUT
RATHER A SYSTEM OF RULES OF
THOUGHT, SO THAT EVEN GOD’S
THOUGHT IS NECESSARILY LOGICAL.
EVEN HE COULD NOT CREATE A
WORLD WHERE A
CONTRADICTION IS
TRUE.

14

Perhaps unsurprisingly, the Church dubbed him a
heretic. But the idea of necessary rules of thought
proved to have a lasting influence on Western
philosophers like Kant, Hegel, Marx and Russell.

WE ALL TRIED TO
GIVE AN ACCOUNT OF
WHAT THIS ESSENTIAL
LOGIC OF THOUGHT
MIGHT BE.

IT SHOULD BE
NOTED, HOWEVER, THAT

THAT NECESSARILY APPLIES
TO THE WORLD.

Frege’s Quantifiers
The Encyclopaedia of Philosophy says that modern logic began
in 1879 with the publication of Gottlob Frege’s Begriffsschrift. It
introduces a propositional calculus which combines Leibniz’s
proof theory with an account of logical connectives. So we did
finally get to Chrysippus.
But the most significant of Frege’s new inventions was the
quantifier. Quantifiers are words like: “all”, “some”, “many” and
“most”. They allow us to say things about groups of objects, e.g.,
“Some men are bald.” Aristotle treated them as subjects to be
predicated in a statement, but this can lead to some silly results,
like this one from Lewis Carroll’s Alice in Wonderland ...

“I see nobody on the road,” said Alice.
“I only wish I had such eyes,” the King
remarked in a fretful tone. “To be able to see
Nobody! And at that distance too! Why, it’s as
much as I can do to see real people ...”

16

Frege manages to avoid this problem by treating quantifiers
as logically separate entities.
He used two quantifiers: “all” and “there is at least one”. This
allows him to translate

“I see nobody on the road”
as either

“For all people I cannot see them on the road”
or

“There is not at least one person such that I can see
them on the road”.
Whilst this is no pretty solution,
it does allow us to avoid
Wonderland-style
silliness in logic.

IT SHOWS US WHY
“I SEE NOBODY ON THE
ROAD” IS ACTUALLY QUITE
DIFFERENT FROM “I SEE A
MESSENGER ON THE
ROAD”.

THE WORD
“NOBODY” DOES NOT
HAVE TO REFER TO AN
OBJECT.

17

The Context Principle
Frege suggested “the context principle” which says that the
smallest unit that logic can deal with is a subject-predicate
statement, or proposition. It is only in the context of a proposition
as a whole that we know the meanings of the words which
compose it.
Take the sentence “I feel cold”. This sentence could be uttered
by various people at various times. The same words “I feel cold”
can be used to express very different propositions, depending
upon the circumstances in which they are used.

Proposition 1

Proposition 2

I FEEL COLD.

I FEEL COLD.

IT SAYS SOMETHING
VERY DIFFERENT WHEN SAID
BY SOCRATES AFTER DRINKING
POISONOUS HEMLOCK THAN
WHEN SAID BY A SMALL
CHILD.

18

Propositional Calculus
Because the fundamental unit of Frege’s logic is the proposition, it is
known as Propositional Calculus. With it we can assess the truth of
complex propositions using connectives. But, more than this, Frege
showed that the connectives themselves are truth-related. A
proposition using one connective, e.g., “if…then…”, may be
transformed into an expression using the other connectives “and”
and “not” without changing the truth of the complex statement.

“IF YOU ARE A
BIRD, THEN YOU
HAVE WINGS” ...

... COULD BE
REPHRASED ...

... “YOU CANNOT
BE A BIRD AND NOT
HAVE WINGS”.

Frege’s logic combines the virtues of
Chrysippus (it allows the analysis of
sentences in terms of logically
connected simple ones) and Leibniz
(the ability to prove one statement from
another by substituting synonyms), and
opens the way to extend these ideas to
include the equivalence of different
connectives. But Frege’s first love was
an attempt to deduce mathematics
from logic.
19

Cantor’s Set Theory
Gottlob Frege (1848–1925) lived at a time of great mathematical
and scientific invention. Among the new and disparate branches
of mathematics, patterns were emerging. This led to an attempt
to base all of mathematics on one set of rules from which every
statement could be derived. Frege thought that his propositional
calculus would fit the bill nicely, but it lacked the tools for
formulating numbers – without which there is only so far you can
go in the formulation of mathematics. Frege’s quantifiers “all”
and “there is at least one” cannot do the work. An apparent
solution came from one of the new branches of mathematics:
Set Theory, developed by Georg Cantor (1845–1918), a
contemporary of Frege.

SETS ARE THE
MOST BASIC
MATHEMATICAL THINGS
IMAGINABLE.

They are basically collections of
elements that do not need to
have anything in common.
Every collection has a specific
number of elements which can
be compared with the number
of elements in other sets.

20

First, we can talk about the common
elements of sets a and b.

a

b

THIS LOOKS LIKE THE
WAY WE USE THE
WORD “AND”.

Second, we have any element
that is a member of a or b.

a

b

THIS LOOKS LIKE THE
WAY WE USE “OR”.

Finally, we can use everything
that is not a member of a.

a

b

CLEARLY, THIS
CORRESPONDS TO THE
WAY WE USE “NOT”.

21

The Usefulness of Connectives
From just three connectives (and, or, not) we can
express every possible logical proposition. For
example, we say the same thing with
“if a then b”
that we say with
“it cannot be the case that a and not-b”.

IF SHE KISSES ME I’LL
TURN INTO A PRINCE.

IT CAN’T BE THE CASE THAT
SHE KISSES YOU AND YOU DON’T
TURN INTO A PRINCE.

THAT’S WHAT I SAID.

MY CALCULUS
CAN WORK FROM
THESE CONNECTIVES
ALONE, AND SETS ALLOW ME
TO TALK ABOUT NUMBERS. SO
BY INCORPORATING SET
THEORY INTO MY CALCULUS I
THINK I CAN OBTAIN A
SOUND BASIS FOR
MATHEMATICS.

22

The Russell Paradox
As Frege was about to publish his theory, to which he had
devoted a good portion of his life, a young English upstart called
Bertrand Russell (1872–1970) pointed out that Frege’s use of
sets leads to a fatal contradiction.

IS IT POSSIBLE FOR
ONE SET TO BELONG TO
ANOTHER?

1 2 3

YES, THE SET OF NUMBERS 1,2
IS CONTAINED IN THE SET OF NUMBERS
1,2,3. ALL ELEMENTS OF THE FIRST SET ARE
MEMBERS OF THE SECOND.

DO YOU SAY THAT
SETS CAN BELONG TO
THEMSELVES?

1 2

=

1 2

YES, FOR THE SAME
REASON. EVERY MEMBER OF THE SET
IS A MEMBER OF THE SET. THE FIRST AND
SECOND SET ARE THE SAME – A BIT LIKE
LEIBNIZ’S LAW.

So far things seem fine, but Russell carries on ...
23

The Fatal Flaw
BUT TELL ME, CAN
YOU ALSO HAVE THE SET OF
SETS – LIKE THE SET OF SETS
WITH MORE THAN THREE
MEMBERS?

I SUPPOSE
YOU CAN.

WHAT ABOUT
THIS SET THEN?
“THE SET OF ALL SETS WHICH
ARE NOT MEMBERS OF
THEMSELVES.”

Russell’s point is that if the set is a member of
itself, then by definition it can’t be a member of
itself. But if it is not a member of itself, then it is a
member of itself. So it is both a member of itself
and not a member of itself. And that is a
contradiction. This glaring mistake, allegedly,
left Frege a broken man.
24

ER ...

The Problem of Surface Grammar
Nevertheless, Russell saw merit in Frege’s work. With his friend
A.N. Whitehead, he tried to ground mathematics on sets and
logic. It took a lot of time to avoid contradictions like Frege’s.
They filled two volumes to attempt a solution! They wanted to
ground the fact that 1+1=2 on something more self-evident…

IT GAVE ME AN IDEA
THAT COULD REVOLUTIONIZE
PHILOSOPHY! LANGUAGE ITSELF WAS
THE PROBLEM! THE SURFACE
GRAMMAR OF SENTENCES HIDES
THEIR TRUE LOGICAL FORM.

The surface grammar (the school
grammar of nouns, verbs and
adjectives) hides the true form of a
sentence. Russell thought that if we
could analyse language into a perfect
logical structure, then many of the
great philosophical problems of the
day would disappear.
25

Russell’s System
Russell brought predicates back into the calculus and
developed Frege’s conception of quantifiers. This allowed him to
distinguish “all” from “some” and it removed the need to analyse
existence as a predicate – which could cause a collection of
problems. He also formalized Aristotle’s square of oppositions by
formulating the relations between quantifiers.
If we say that “all birds have wings”, and that “there is not one
thing that is a bird and does not have wings”, then we have said
the same thing. The quantifiers “all” and “there is at least one”
are interchangeable – one can be substituted for the other with
negation symbols in the relevant places.

MINE IS THE FIRST
SYSTEM IN WHICH YOU
CAN DO ANYTHING YOU
COULD DO IN ANY SYSTEM
OF LOGIC THAT CAME
BEFORE.
26

Take this sentence:
“The present King of France is bald.”
Is this true or false? It could appear as true, false or as neither.
But if it is false, does that mean that the present King of France
is not bald? Of course, if it is neither true nor false, that means
that the sentence does not make any claim at all. It simply does
not say anything about the world.
Russell thought that this sentence is actually made up of three
combined claims ...
1. There is a present King of France
2. There is exactly one present King of France
3. The present King of France is bald
This combined claim would only be true if all three claims are
true. We know that the first condition is false, so the combined
claim is also false. But this does not make the opposite claim
true, as it may be analysed as follows ...
1. There is a present King of France
2. There is exactly one present King of France
3. The present King of France is not bald
And this collection of sentences is clearly false.

27

Wittgenstein’s Logical Pictures
Russell ruled the English philosophy scene for about a decade
until an Austrian Jew called Ludwig Wittgenstein (1889–1951)
gave up a potentially lucrative career in engineering to become
a pupil of Russell’s in 1912. While on active service during the
First World War, he composed the first of his two major works:
the Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus. This conceived of
philosophy as an analysis of hidden logical structure – with
definitive attacks on Frege and Russell. Wittgenstein’s main
interest was always to understand the relation between
language, logic and the world.
He read in the papers that
in Paris law courts, models
of cars were used to
represent the actual
location of vehicles in road
traffic accidents. That gave
him a brilliant idea.

THIS CAN BE DONE IF WE SEE
LANGUAGE AS A PICTURE OF THE
WORLD.

28

What any picture must have in common with reality in order to be
able to depict it at all is logical form – the form of reality. For
Wittgenstein, logic was something that both the world and
language must have in common. It is only because language
has something in common with the world that it can be used to
picture the world, so it is only because of logic that our
sentences have meaning at all.

THIS IS PRECISELY WHY OUR
SENTENCES ARE IN PERFECT LOGICAL ORDER.
THIS IS GUARANTEED BY THE FACT THAT OUR
SENTENCES HAVE MEANING.

A picture that does not have
logical form simply does not
represent anything at all. Just as a
Pollock or Rothko abstract
painting does not picture reality.

IT’S TRUE, THIS
IS NOT A PIPE. BUT
IT IS A LOGICAL
REPRESENTATION
OF ONE.

“It used to be said that God could
create anything except an
illogical world but the truth is that
we could not say of an illogical
world what it would look like.”
(Tractatus 3.031).

29

Carnap and the Vienna Circle
Logic, since Frege, has developed in conjunction with the
problem of founding mathematics and solving problems in
language. With Rudolf Carnap (1891–1970) the emphasis was
mainly on science. Originally a pupil of Frege’s, but greatly
influenced by Wittgenstein’s Tractatus, Carnap was one of the
superstars of the Vienna Circle (a group of philosophers and
scientists who wanted to purge philosophy of anything that was
neither scientifically verifiable nor a law of logic). “Philosophy is
to be replaced by the logic of science and the logic of science is
the logical syntax of the language of science.” (Carnap, The
Logical Syntax of Language, 1934)
Carnap deployed his formidable logical skill trying to develop a
rigorous account of any possible formal language.

I SAW THIS AS
A NECESSARY
PRECURSOR TO THE
ONLY LEGITIMATE FORM
OF PHILOSOPHICAL
ENQUIRY – LOGICAL
ANALYSIS.

Unfortunately this idea restricted language to such an extent that
the Vienna Circle often found it hard to express their views.
“...we appointed one of us to shout ‘M’ (for metaphysics)
whenever an illegitimate sentence was uttered in our discussion.
He was shouting ‘M’ so much that we got sick of it and got him to
shout ‘not-M’ whenever we said something legitimate.”
30

The Tolerance Principle

READING THE
TRACTATUS INSPIRED
ME TO THINK THAT I COULD
DERIVE ALL MEANINGFUL
SENTENCES FROM LOGIC
AND SENSE-EXPERIENCE
ALONE .

THIS IS NOT EXACTLY
THE MESSAGE OF MY BOOK. MY
ACCOUNT OF MEANING CAME
FROM THE WORLD, NOT FROM
SENSE-EXPERIENCE.

Carnap’s bid to reduce all language began to flounder almost as
soon as he began to work out its consequences. As an older
man, having already produced one very long book (the Aufbau)
to defend his radical approach, Carnap came to relax his view
as outlined in another very long book (Logical Syntax).
Carnap’s most important contribution to the history of logic and
formal languages is the introduction of the “tolerance principle”,
according to which there is not one but many logics. Any
expression in language is acceptable as long as there are
sufficient rules governing its logical application.
31

Hilbert’s Proof Theory
Frege and Russell’s attempts to
reduce maths to logic and set theory
are part of many attempts in the
early 20th century to base maths on
solid logical grounds. Another
notable attempt came from David
Hilbert (1862–1943), who pioneered
a form of logic called “Proof Theory”
or metamathematics.

Broadly speaking, Hilbert’s method
rests on the idea that we could
unquestionably establish the
consistency of something like
geometry, say, if we could show that
we cannot derive from its axioms
something equivalent to saying “1=0”,
which is a prime mathematical
absurdity. Hilbert, like Leibniz before
him, used the reductio as his main tool.

who was destined to become the

Gödel’s Incompleteness Theorem
When Gödel was 24 and trying to expand his results
to cover arithmetic, he ended up with a thoroughly
unexpected result. He discovered that any system
complicated enough to be used as a basis for
arithmetic will be incomplete. This means
that Hilbert’s project of grounding
mathematics on a finite number
of axioms could never get
off the ground for
arithmetic, let alone
anything more
complicated like
calculus.

At this time, Gödel lived a hand-tomouth existence in Vienna, working in
an unpaid position. After the arrival of
the Nazis, his friends and colleagues
gradually escaped to America. The
apolitical Gödel was reluctant to leave –
until he was found fit to serve in the

Modern logic may be divided into three connected projects.
These are: mathematical logic, symbolic logic and
philosophical logic.

THEY ARE ABSTRACT ENTITIES WHOSE

TO APPLY LOGIC TO ACTUAL CONCEPTS.
INSTEAD OF PURE SYMBOLS, IT DEALS WITH
THE INTERACTION OF REAL CONCEPTS
LIKE PROBABILITY AND BELIEF.

The connecting feature
Mathematical logic
between these
branches of logic is
their reliance on
Proof Theory –
that which
Proof
enables us to
Theory
tell if one
statement
Philosophical logic
Symbolic logic
follows from
another.

35

Proof Theory contains a variety of methods to
show what logically follows from a logical
sentence or “formula” – a string of symbols
connected by bits of logical syntax. It does this
by giving rigid definitions to bits of logical syntax.
THE LOGICAL SYNTAX
WILL AFFECT THE TRUTH OF
A STATEMENT. SO I DEFINED
PIECES OF LOGICAL SYNTAX IN
TERMS OF TRUTH AND
FALSITY.

FOR EXAMPLE, THE
LOGICAL CONNECTIVE “&” IN
“THE SKY IS GREY & IT IS RAINING”
IS TRUE ONLY IF THE SIMPLE SENTENCES
“THE SKY IS GREY” AND “IT IS RAINING”
ARE BOTH TRUE.

The idea of defining logical connectives
in terms of truth and falsity really took off
amongst logicians, so much so that
almost nobody has seen fit to change it.
The reality is that when Frege talks about
the truth of “&”, the meaning of the
sentence is irrelevant. What is important
is that we know if the sentence is either
true or false. The behaviour of the
connective is unaffected by what the
sentence says. For this reason, Frege
used simple symbols, like p and q, to do
duty for whole sentences – another idea
that soon became very fashionable
amongst logicians.

36

Wittgenstein’s Table of
Logical Connectives
Wittgenstein invented a method of representing logical
connectives as a simple table, and so saved everyone the
bother of using Frege’s verbose machinery.
Suppose we represent “The sky is grey” as “p” and “It is raining”
as “q“. Each of them may be either true or false, so altogether we
have four possibilities, which may be represented as follows.

WHEN “p” IS TRUE
AND “q” IS TRUE THEN
“p&q” WILL BE TRUE.
BUT WHEN ONE OR BOTH ARE
FALSE, THE COMPLEX
SENTENCE CANNOT BE TRUE,
WHICH GIVES US THE
SIMPLE TABLE ...

p

q

T

T

T

F

F

T

F

F

We can extend
this table to
show the way
that the
connective “&”
works in the
sentence “p&q”.

Wittgenstein’s Truth Tables
These ideas give us two things: one is mostly relevant to
logicians, whilst the other is relevant to all of us in our everyday
lives. Logicians use truth tables simply to represent the truth of
any logically connected string of sentences. But
perhaps more important to our everyday lives
THESE TOO MAY
is the fact that these connectives lie at the
BE REPRESENTED BY MY
base of much of modern electronics. To
TRUTH TABLE METHOD.
begin to grasp either application, we
TRUTH
TABLES CAN BE USED
need to understand two more logical
TO DEFINE THE
connectives.
The first connective we need is “v”
(read “or”) which may be defined as ...

p

q

pvq

T

T

T

T

F

T

F

T

T

F

F

F

This connective is true if either “p” or “q”
is true and it is only false when both are
false. It roughly corresponds to “and/or”
in English.
The other connective we need is “¬”
(read “not”) which only applies to one
sentence. Its Truth Table looks like this ...

p ¬p
T

F

F

T

“¬” roughly corresponds to the
English “It is not the case that”, as in
“It is not the case that Clinton is
President of the United States.”

38

CONNECTIVES THEY
REPRESENT.

Discovering Tautologies
Logical symbols may be used in combination, which can help us
calculate the truth condition of any logically complex sentences.
For example, “p v ¬p”, which produces the following Truth Table:

p

¬p

p v ¬p

T

F

T

F

T

T

When a formula only has T’s under it in a Truth Table, it means
that it is true in all situations. The sentence “Either it is raining or
it is not raining” cannot be false. Logicians call this a tautology.

WITH MY TRUTH
TABLES, YOU CAN
EASILY DISCOVER ALL THE
TAUTOLOGIES THAT CAN BE
EXPRESSED USING
SIMPLE SYMBOLS.

In a tautology, one truth follows from another of
necessity only because of the logical syntax. So we
know that any sentence with the same logical syntax
will always be true. This is important to Proof Theory
because it provides us with a sound base for proving
that a logical argument is necessarily true.
39

The Logic Gates of Digital
Electronics
Modern life would be unrecognizable without digital
electronics and digital electronics is not a lot more
than an instantiation of logic. Digital electronics can
be found everywhere from microwaves to mobile
phones. Digital electronics relies on “logic gates” –
basically switches – that let current through,
depending on their input. For example, an “And Gate”
has two inputs and one output but will only let current
through if there is current at
both of the inputs. The
behaviour of an And Gate may
be represented as follows ...

Input 1 Input 2 Output
1
1
1
1
0
0
0
1
0
0
0
0

An And Gate has exactly the
same Truth Table as the
logical connective “&”. Just as
the meaning of the sentences
was unimportant when looking
at the behaviour of “&”, so the
amount of current is
unimportant to the behaviours
of And Gates. Pretty much all
digital electronics is
constructed out of “And
Gates”, “Or Gates” and “Not
Gates”, which correspond to
the logical connectives “&”,
“v” and “¬”. They are
immensely powerful tools
based on logic.

AGAIN, MY TRUTH
TABLES PROVE
USEFUL.

40

A Vending Machine
Just as logical formulae are constructed out of logical
connectives, so logic gates may be used to construct devices
like vending machines and ATM’s.

Alan Turing

THE HEART OF A
VENDING MACHINE IS NO MORE
COMPLICATED THAN A NUMBER OF
AND GATES STRUNG TOGETHER.
JUST LOOK AT THIS SIMPLE
DIAGRAM ...
INSERT
COIN
LIGHT

CASH
COUNTER

DISPENSE
SELECTION

SELECTION
BUTTONS

AND GATE
NOT GATE

41

The cash counter is a
simple device that
checks if there is enough
money in the machine.
When there is enough
money it gives out a
signal “1”, the rest of the
time it outputs “0”. If the
output is “0” then the Not
Gate will reverse it and
turn on the “insert coin”
light. If the cash counter
outputs “1” then the Not
Gate would turn off the
“insert coin” light, and
each of the And Gates
receives one input at “1”.
When a product is
selected, the
corresponding And
Gate’s second input
becomes “1” and it now
gives out a “1” signal,
releasing the product of
choice.

Turing and the “Enigma Code”
The actions of the vending machine follow necessarily from the
actions of the buyer. We can also see the actions of the machine
as the proof of a given formula. This idea predates logic gates. It
comes from Alan Turing’s (1912–54) attempts to crack the
Enigma Machine, an ingenious German encryption device that
was thought foolproof in World War ll.

THE GERMAN TRICK
WAS TO ALTER THE CODE
VERY REGULARLY. THE FIRST
LINE OF THE MESSAGE TOLD THE
MACHINE WHAT THE CODE WAS,
BUT THIS MESSAGE COULD ONLY
BE DECODED BY A MACHINE
THAT WAS BUILT THE
RIGHT WAY.

Turing tried to crack any
possible Enigma code, not
just the code for any given
message. He was looking
for a programmable
machine that could have its
settings changed, and this
would eventually become
the computer. But it took
about 20 years for his idea
to be realized in electronic
form.
In essence, computers are
nothing more than giant
logical “proving” devices.

42

Euclid’s Axiomatic Method
Truth Tables are a good way to model simple electronic devices.
But when it comes to doing logic, the prospect of proving a
formula using a thirty-line Truth Table is hardly appetizing.
Happily, there are other methods.

G

F

The first, most common official method of
serious modern logic is the “axiomatic”
method of proof. It is based on the
idea that we can derive all logical
tautologies from two or three
simple statements that are taken
to be true. It owes its origins to
Euclid (325–265 BC), the
ancient Greek mathematician.

E

Euclid’s system is still taught in schools today. His method of
constructing a system has taken on a life of its own, since the
results it generates are amazingly convincing. This is because
the axiomatic method works like a “truth pump” – it makes truth
flow from the axioms to the proven statements. The truth of every
proven statement is guaranteed by the truth of the axioms.

I CHOSE THE
MOST SELF-EVIDENT
AXIOMS I COULD, AS
THE MORE CERTAIN WE
ARE OF THE TRUTH OF THE
AXIOMS, THE MORE
CERTAIN WE CAN BE OF
THE STATEMENTS
DERIVED FROM
THEM.

I DEVELOPED MY LOGIC
FROM EUCLID’S SYSTEM BASED
ON FOUR AXIOMS THAT BECAME PART
OF THE CANON FOR ALL LATER
DEVELOPMENTS.

Aristotle was not overly fond of
mathematics, so during his
posthumous thousand-year
reign over Western philosophy,
Euclid’s method was put to little
use outside mathematics.
Galileo first thought of applying
it to physics with famously
groundbreaking results. He was
soon followed by the French
philosopher René Descartes
(1596–1650) who applied it to
philosophy, thereby kickstarting the Enlightenment. It
was then only a matter of time
before Leibniz used it as a
proof method in logic.

44

Leibniz’s Proof Method
1. The first axiom is Leibniz’s famous law of identity,
“everything is identical with itself”, or “a = a”.
The rest are reworkings of some of Aristotle’s rules.
2. The “law of non-contradiction” which says that no statement is
both true and false at the same time, or “¬(p&¬p)”.
3. The “law of excluded middle” which says that every statement
is either true or false, or “pv¬p”.
4. A law of substitution which allows
us to substitute one
expression for
TAKEN TOGETHER, THE
another, keeping
LAWS OF NON-CONTRADICTION
the same truthAND EXCLUDED MIDDLE GUARANTEE
conditions,
THAT ANY STATEMENT THAT CAN BE
or “(a is b) and
FORMULATED IN LOGIC MUST HAVE ONLY
(b is c) = a is c”.
ONE TRUTH VALUE – IT MUST BE
EITHER TRUE OR FALSE.
I CAN THEN
SAFELY DEDUCE THAT A
STATEMENT IS FALSE WHEN
IT IS NOT TRUE, A RESULT
PRETTY MUCH SELFEVIDENT.

ARMED WITH THIS
AND THE KNOWLEDGE
THAT A CONTRADICTION IS
NEVER TRUE, WE HAVE THE
BASIS OF MY REDUCTIO
METHOD.

45

WE CAN REJECT ANY
STATEMENT THAT LEADS TO
A CONTRADICTION AS
FALSE.

Abuse of
Contradiction
Logicians worry about
contradictions not only
because they are always
false but also because if
they were unavoidable
they would destroy the
links between the truth of
one statement and the truth
of another. This is because
the Leibnizian reductio allows
us to prove anything we want
from a contradiction.
Suppose we have a contradiction
such as p&¬p and we want to
prove q which can stand for any
statement we want, such as
“elephants only drink bottled water”.
All we need to do is apply the
reductio method to ¬q.
So we assume ¬q.
We quote the contradiction
p&¬p.
p&¬p violates Leibniz’s
second axiom. The reductio
method tells us to reject the
assumption, which in this case
was ¬q.
So we reject the assumption,
which gives us ¬¬q.
It follows from the third axiom that
if ¬¬q is true, then q is true.
This is a weird result because it allows us to prove
anything, even something whose truth does not depend
on the truth of the contradiction used to prove it.

46

Rules for Connectives
The application of the axiomatic
method reached maturity in
Russell and Whitehead’s Principia
Mathematica. The system in this
book is a serious contender for
grounding mathematics on set
theory. The problem is that many
of the axioms it uses are far from
simple, some are less self-evident
than the things they are seeking to
prove, e.g., 1+1=2. Nevertheless,
a refined version of the method it
employed is still in use today, and
is called “natural deduction”.

WE CAN
CONSTRUCT ANY WELLFORMED LOGICAL FORMULA
IF WE KNOW THE
CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH WE
CAN INTRODUCE OR REMOVE
A NEW CONNECTIVE FROM
THE FORMULA ...

&v¬
THE BEHAVIOUR OF
EACH CONNECTIVE MAY BE
EXHAUSTIVELY MAPPED OUT –
AS WAS LATER SHOWN BY
WITTGENSTEIN’S TRUTH
TABLES.

It is a short step from this to a collection of rules that state
exactly when we can legitimately introduce a connective. Each
connective has one rule for its introduction and one for its
elimination. For example, if we have a proposition q, and if we
can show that taking it to be true leads to a contradiction (the
reductio method), then we can introduce “¬” to make it “¬q”. We
can eliminate a negation by arriving at a double negative, since
¬¬p (it is not the case that it is not the case that the sky is grey)
is the same as saying p (the sky is grey).
47

Sensitivity to Grammar
Despite the numerous strengths of natural
deduction in Propositional Calculus, it still
cannot show why the first of Aristotle’s
syllogisms is valid. It just cannot cope with
the transition from
“All men are mortal”
and

“Socrates is a man”
to

“Socrates is mortal”.
The problem is that Propositional Calculus
renders whole statements into simple
symbols, so “All men are mortal” becomes
“p”. Because the logical relation between
statements like the above seems to
depend on the actual wording of the
sentences, there is just no way to show the
logical dependency between the three
symbols that make up Aristotle’s first
syllogism. For example, if we did a truth
table we would not get a tautology.
FOR PRECISELY THIS
REASON, I REINTRODUCED
ARISTOTLE’S DISTINCTION BETWEEN
SUBJECT AND PREDICATE – OBJECTS
AND THE THINGS WE SAY ABOUT
THEM – INTO MY LOGIC.

This might be
seen as making
logic sensitive
to the grammar
of the sentences
in an argument.

NOT THE ACTUAL
WORDS, BUT THE STRUCTURE
OF THE SENTENCES BECOMES
MIRRORED IN THE LOGICAL
SYMBOLS.

48

Predicate Calculus
In Russell’s Predicate Calculus, lowercase letters stand for
objects: a, b, c … stand for specific-named objects and x, y, z
stand for as yet unspecified objects. Capitals stand for
predicates.
A
Russell also used special symbols to represent quantifiers: “ x”
stands for “all” and ”Ex“ stands for “there is at least one”. All the
other connectives behave as they did in Propositional Calculus.
With this apparatus in place we can account for any possible
syllogism.

WHERE
ARISTOTLE HAD ...
NO HUMAN IS IMMORTAL.
SOCRATES IS HUMAN.
SOCRATES IS MORTAL.

WE HAVE ...

A

x¬(Hx & ¬Mx)
Hs
Ms

We can prove this syllogism using an expanded version of the
introduction and elimination rules from Propositional Calculus.
Unfortunately we cannot construct Truth Tables to check
formulae of Predicate Calculus, as they are simply not equipped
to capture the relation between the truth of general statements
and the truth of statements that fall under them.
49

Model Theoretic Semantics
Whilst Truth Tables do not work for Predicate Calculus, there are
other methods. The most important of them employs very simple
models of the world. The model provides us with a way of
checking the truth of statements in Predicate Calculus relative to
a given list of objects and predicates.

MODELS ALLOW US TO
ATTACH MEANING TO LOGICAL
FORMULAE AND SO INVESTIGATE THE
TRUTH OF PARTICULAR STATEMENTS
RELATIVE TO A GIVEN SITUATION. THIS IS
CALLED MODEL THEORETIC SEMANTICS.
WITHOUT IT, ALL WE CAN DO IS SHOW
THAT AN ARGUMENT IS VALID,
THAT IF Px THEN Qx.

THIS IS A GREAT IDEA,
BECAUSE ONCE THE MODEL
BECOMES LARGE AND COMPLICATED
ENOUGH, WE CAN APPLY IT TO THOUGHT
ITSELF. THAT WOULD BE A GREAT HELP IN
UNDERSTANDING THE HUMAN MIND AND
IN CONSTRUCTING MACHINES THAT
CAN EMULATE IT.

But before we can put this
semantics to great use, we need
a grammatical system on which to
pin it. This grammatical system
must allow us to construct a
potentially infinite number of
sentences from a finite
number of rules.
50

WITH MODEL
THEORETIC SEMANTICS
WE CAN FIND OUT IN WHAT
MODELS “SOCRATES IS A
MAN” IS TRUE.

Hilbert’s Recursion Model
Precisely such a tool was developed by Hilbert in his work on
the foundations of mathematics. Unimpressed by the idea of
reducing mathematics to logic, Hilbert wanted a mathematical
version of Proof Theory – a way to prove mathematical
statements from within mathematics. The name “Proof Theory”
is actually Hilbert’s.
IN ARITHMETIC, ANY
WELL-FORMED FORMULA CAN BE
THE BASIS OF ANY OTHER WELLFORMED FORMULA, PROVIDING THAT
WE FOLLOW THE RULES.

This continued re-application is called
recursion and is vital for the construction
of models. It allows us to construct an
infinite number of sentences from a few
simple rules and a finite vocabulary.

Hilbert had a view of
mathematics that he called
formalism. The idea is that the
things mathematics talks about
are nothing but symbols. These
symbols are, by themselves,
meaningless – you know
everything about them when you
know how to manipulate them.
He gave recursive rules to
explain their possible
interactions.

THE MOST FAMOUS
MATHEMATICAL ENTITY IS THE
NUMBER. ALL POSITIVE WHOLE
NUMBERS CAN BE CONSTRUCTED
FROM TWO SIMPLE RULES:

“1 IS A NUMBER”

Since mathematicians already
know how to construct every
number with the help of positive
whole numbers and zero, these two
rules are, more or less, all you need
to construct any number. Hilbert’s
rules are both simple and effective.
In effect, they treat mathematics as
a formal language made up of a
vocabulary and a syntax. The
syntax allows you to create
sentences of the language without
having a clue to what they mean.
The vocabulary is no more than a
collection of blanks with
grammatical properties: names,
verbs and the like. Just as we know
to put a name with a verb to form a
complete sentence in English, even
if we do not know whose name it is.

AND
“ANY NUMBER PLUS 1
IS A NUMBER”.

Consider a model language made up only of the
following terms ...
Predicates

Names

Evolved into

Homo sapiens
Homo sapiens sapiens
Homo erectus
Homo habilis

And the following simple grammatical rules:
1.

sentence =
name, predicate, name

2.

sentence =
sentence, “which”, predicate, name

The first rule shows how to build a wellformed formula out of the sequence
name, predicate, name.
For example, “Homo erectus evolved
into Homo sapiens”.
The second rule shows how to build
a new well-formed formula out of a
sentence that already exists and
in addition the sequence
“which”, predicate, name.
For example, “Homo
erectus evolved into
Homo sapiens which
evolved into Homo
habilis”.
Using this model we can
construct an infinite
number of sentences via the
recursive application of Rule
Two. Of course only a few of these
sentences will be true, but it should
now be clear that this familiar diagram is
yet another application of logic.

53

Finite Rules for Infinite
Production
The American philosopher Donald
Davidson (b.1917) has suggested that
we can apply this idea to English and
every other natural language, filling in
the gaps with a semantic model.
“We must give an account of how the
meanings of sentences depend on the
meanings of words. Unless such an
account could be supplied for a
particular language, there would be no
explaining the fact that we can learn that
language: no explaining the fact that on
mastering a finite vocabulary and a
finitely stated set of rules, we are
prepared to produce and understand a
potential infinitude of sentences.”
(Truth and Meaning, 1966)
Languages like English are potentially
infinite, if we continue to apply words
like “and”.
EITHER THERE IS A FINITE
OR AN INFINITE NUMBER OF RULES
GOVERNING EACH POSSIBLE USE OF
THE WORD “AND”. IF THE RULES WERE
INFINITE, THEN WE COULD NOT
LEARN THEM.

We must be able to apply the
rules recursively in order to
produce a potentially
infinite number of sentences.
Davidson concludes that
English, or any other
language that we actually use,
could be described as a huge
model. So the application of
formal languages to natural
languages gets a philosophical
seal of approval.
54

BUT IF THERE IS
ONLY A FINITE NUMBER OF
RULES, THEN THEY CAN
BE LEARNED.

Simple Instructions
If Davidson is right, then language is a bit like Lego. It is made
up of blocks (words) that have to be combined correctly.
Instructions for how to connect one block to another will give the
instructions to build any possible Lego structure.
What Davidson is really interested in is how the meaning of each
individual word contributes to the meaning of the sentence. For
example, the sentence ...

I wal
ked

slowly

can be analysed as
“There is an event in which I walked and the event happened
slowly”
( E x)(Wx&Sx).
Here is an analysis of a statement in English – built out of the
conjunction of two simple statements which consist of a subject
and a predicate.
Davidson’s account has two principal virtues. First, it neatly fits
his learnability conditions. Second, it provides an account of
language that preserves much of our intuitive grasp on natural
language. For example, “I am walking” follows from “I am
walking slowly” because in Proof Theory “Wx” follows from
“Wx&Sx”.
Davidson devoted more than a decade to analysing different
parts of language into this sort of logical form.
55

Proof Theory and Formal Language
Davidson encourages us to think of all adjectives, adverbs and
prepositions as predicates strung together. This contrasts with
Russell’s analysis of those linguistic terms.

I SAY THAT “I WENT
SKIING WITH A FRIEND” IS A
SINGLE PREDICATE THAT SAYS
SOMETHING ABOUT TWO SUBJECTS. A
PREDICATE LIKE “WENT SKIING WITH”
ONLY MAKES SENSE IF THERE ARE
TWO SUBJECTS ATTACHED.

BUT RUSSELL, HOW CAN YOU ACCOUNT
FOR THE FACT THAT “I WENT SKIING WITH A FRIEND”
ACTUALLY ENTAILS “I WENT SKIING”?

I CAN’T, BECAUSE IN
PROOF THEORY THERE IS NO
WAY TO ACCOUNT FOR THE
ENTAILMENT FROM A TWO PLACE
PREDICATE TO A ONE PLACE
PREDICATE. PROOF THEORY LACKS
THE RELEVANT SEMANTIC
MACHINERY.

56

NOT ONLY THAT, BUT IN ENGLISH WE
COULD EXTEND OUR ACCOUNT INDEFINITELY. FOR
EXAMPLE: “I WENT SKIING WITH A FRIEND IN THE WINTER
IN THE ALPS WHERE IT IS COLD …” ON YOUR ACCOUNT,
RUSSELL, WE NEED A NEW PREDICATE FOR EACH
SUBSEQUENT ADDITION. THIS MEANS WE WOULD NEED A
POTENTIAL INFINITY OF PREDICATES, AND THAT IS
UNLEARNABLE.

IF WE
CONSTRUCT THE
SENTENCES MY WAY, WITH
A STRING OF DIFFERENT
PREDICATES LINKED BY
CONJUNCTIONS, THEN A
SIMPLE RECURSIVE RULE
CAN ACCOUNT FOR
ALL OF THEM.

At root, Davidson is trying to understand English as a formal
language. To do this, he needs a way of deciding under what
conditions sentences of English are true.
Davidson adopted an account of truth in formal languages
developed by a Berkeley colleague, Alfred Tarski (1902–83).
Tarski developed a distinction between the formal language and
the language used to speak about the formal language (the
metalanguage).
57

Tarski’s Truth Conditions
Tarski provided a set of conditions that allow us to say when a
sentence of a formal language under study is true. The result is
startlingly simple.
S IS TRUE IF,
AND ONLY IF, p.

In Tarski’s schema, “S” is
a sentence of a formal
language and “p” is the
translation of S into the
metalanguage. If the
metalanguage is English
and the formal language
contains English
sentences, we can say
“‘Snow is white’ if, and
only if, snow is white.”
Tarski’s schema looks less
trivial if we use it to state
the truth conditions of a
foreign language: “La
THE PREDICATE
neige est blanche” is
“IS TRUE” IS NEVER
true if and only if
PROPERLY APPLIED WITHIN A
snow is white. It looks

La neige est blanche

58

Davidson thinks that our
understanding of English
can be explained by
understanding a list of
sentences built around
Tarski’s schema.

HAVING SUCH A LIST
IS ALL THAT IS REQUIRED TO
ACCOUNT FOR OUR
UNDERSTANDING OF OUR NATURAL
LANGUAGE, BECAUSE IF WE KNOW
THE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH A
SENTENCE IS TRUE, THEN WE
UNDERSTAND HOW TO USE
THAT SENTENCE.

So even something as superficially simple as
“ ‘Snow is white’ is true if, and only if, snow is white.”
is all that is required to begin to do duty for a theory of
meaning, according to Davidson. When this is combined
with Davidson’s attempt to show how the truth conditions
of sentences depend on the truth conditions of their
parts, then the ground is set for working out the truth
conditions of every possible sentence in English.
59

Formal Semantics
in Practice
The great practical advantage of
formal semantics lies in our ability
to build machines that respond to
a formally defined language – all
computers are such machines.

ANY COMPUTER
LANGUAGE IS COMPOSED OF
A VOCABULARY AND RULES
DESCRIBING HOW TO MAKE WELLFORMED STATEMENTS IN THAT
LANGUAGE. ALL PROGRAMS
WRITTEN IN THE LANGUAGE
CONSIST OF SUCH WELLFORMED STATEMENTS.

But this does not only apply to
computers. Modern particle
physics is done within formal
languages, with quantum theory
providing the model. Often we
don’t even know what the terms
used in the model – like photons
and electrons – mean outside of
the model. Electrons have never
been directly observed: their
properties define what they are
and compose their formal
identity in scientists’
models. The interactions
between particles in the
model can be seen as
syntactical rules
governing their behaviour.
The achievement of
physicists is to show that
their models correspond to
experimental results.

60

Constructing a Soap Opera
We can construct formal languages to model almost anything.
Here is one used to construct the plot of a typical soap opera:

Predicates

Characters

Connectives

Dies
Has an affair
Is bankrupt

Billy-Anne
Esmarelda
Zulika
Juan
John-Bob
Eric
Dwayne

and
or
because

Loves
Hates
Has an affair with

Notice the
difference between
predicates that take
one character like
“has an affair” and
those that take two
like “has an affair
with”. They require
separate rules of
combination. The
connectives do not
have to be “logical”
in the same way as
the connectives of Predicate Calculus, but their behaviour in the
language will be exhaustively defined. All possible well-formed
formulae may be generated from the following rules ...
1.

For one-place predicates:
sentence = name, predicate

2.

For two-place predicates:
sentence = name, predicate, name

3.

For the connectives:
sentence = simple sentence, connective, simple sentence

From this we can arrive at a potentially infinite number of
sentences: “Juan is bankrupt”, “Billy-Anne loves Eric”, “John-Bob
dies because Esmarelda has an affair with Zulika” …

61

Prolog to an AI Soap Opera
While all computer languages are formal languages, some
show their true nature more blatantly than others. Within
most computer languages the vocabulary and grammar
are pre-set; but languages like Prolog allow the computer
to develop its own programming.

THE MOTIVATION
COMES FROM MY IDEA THAT
MACHINES COULD HAVE SKILLS
OF LEARNING, SELFCORRECTION AND
COMMUNICATION.

THIS FORMS THE
BASIS OF MOST ATTEMPTS
AT CREATING ARTIFICIAL
INTELLIGENCE (AI).

With Prolog the idea is
simple. The computer is
given a model similar to,
but more complex than, the
soap opera language. The
vocabulary is made up of
words for the computer to use
and instructions for it to
perform. The computer can
then be set specific tasks
based on that vocabulary.
It can also identify bits
of vocabulary that it
does not possess,
and ask for them.

Prolog’s vocabulary
consists of “facts” which
are statements
composed of predicates

and
“Went to the moon

A set of rules is added to
give structure and link one
fact to another, so ...
“The first man on the moon was
Neil Armstrong”
becomes
“The first man on the moon
(x):- x = Neil Armstrong”.
The final element takes the
form of questions in
which the machine
is set certain
tasks, thus
“? first man

would receive
the answer ...

Turing’s recipe for AI
To prepare an intelligent machine, we need ...

1. A model with a vocabulary rich enough to represent the real
world.
2. This model will then be used to build a picture of the world.
You might find a dash of self-learning helpful here.
3. Now we need to put together the input and output devices.
The input should be composed of devices similar to our own
senses. The output is comprised of behavioural responses
appropriate to the world picture we created earlier.

PRESENTED IN THE
RIGHT WAY, THIS WOULD BE
INDISTINGUISHABLE FROM
YOUR NEXT-DOOR
NEIGHBOUR.

64

As well as showing that machines can be programmable, using
something like a formal language, Turing also paved the way for
building the first digital computers. It was Turing who discovered
that vacuum tubes could be used to store information
electronically. Up to this point, all his machines had been
mechanical. The introduction of the vacuum tube saw cogs
replaced by electronics. Today, transistors have replaced
vacuum tubes, but the principle remains unchanged.
Turing committed suicide in 1954, perhaps driven to it by brutal
treatment from the British legal system. Despite his tremendous
contribution to the war effort and his inspired later work on
computers and AI, in 1952 Turing was put on trial for “gross
indecency” – in short for being gay.

The Problem of Paradoxes
As with most things in logic, Proof Theory at
first glance looks dry and obscure. Often the
practical side of its applications as a method
of logical proof seems limited. But it forms
the skeleton of much of our science,
mathematics and computer technology. One
of Proof Theory’s virtues is its ability to
guarantee a single repeatable result every
time it is applied to a particular string of
symbols, which is more than can be said for
the majority of scientific experiments.
However, if the string of symbols in question
contains a contradiction, the method’s
effectiveness breaks down, as anything
follows from a contradiction.

WHEN RUSSELL
DISCOVERED A
PARADOX IN MY SYSTEM
OF LOGIC, IT MADE
EVERYONE, EVEN ME, REJECT
THE SYSTEM. THE PARADOX HE
DISCOVERED WAS AN
UNAVOIDABLE
CONTRADICTION BUILT
INTO THE SYSTEM.

FREGE BECAME
AN OBJECT LESSON
FOR LOGICIANS WHO
HAVE BEEN TRYING TO
AVOID PARADOXES
EVER SINCE.
66

PERHAPS THE
MOST FAMOUS GREEK
PARADOX IS THE SO-CALLED
“LIAR PARADOX” WHICH IN
ITS MOST SIMPLE FORM
LOOKS LIKE THIS ...

A paradox is a statement that entails its
negation. This is a logician’s nightmare
because it does not matter whether we
assume the sentence to be true or false,
we always arrive at a contradiction. This
makes it very hard to hold onto the law of
non-contradiction (no sentence can be
both true and false at the same time). The
word “paradox” is Greek in origin, and with
good reason. Sceptics in ancient Greece
wanted to show that reason could not lead
to absolute knowledge – the paradox was
their principal weapon. The most notorious
of these philosophical reprobates was
Zeno of Elea (c.495–c.430 BC).

This
Sentence
is False.
The problem here is that if the sentence is
true, then it is false; but if it is false, then it
must be true. If we assume it to be either
true or false, it still leads to a
contradiction. This is the most notorious of
a family of self-referential paradoxes.
They are called “self-referential” because
the sentence speaks of itself.
67

Can Paradoxes
be Avoided?
Paradoxes pose
serious problems for
the logical systems of
Leibniz, Frege and
Russell. They allow the
formulation of
contradictions within
very simple systems.
Logicians have tried to
avoid the liar paradox
in a number of different
ways, none of which is
very convincing.

ONE ATTEMPT TO AVOID
THE LIAR PARADOX IS TO BAR ANY
SELF-REFERENTIAL SENTENCES FROM
LOGICAL SYSTEMS. BUT THIS HAS
TWO PROBLEMS:

1.
SOME SELF-REFERENTIAL
SENTENCES ARE TOTALLY
HARMLESS, E.G., “THIS SENTENCE
HAS FIVE WORDS.”

2.
WE CAN CONSTRUCT A
PARADOX THAT WORKS AS A LIAR
PARADOX THAT IS NOT SELFREFERENTIAL ...

HIS SIGN IS TRUE

HER SIGN IS FALSE

THIS WORKS IN
THE SAME WAY AS THE
TRADITIONAL LIAR PARADOX.
IF HIS SIGN IS TRUE, THEN
HER SIGN IS FALSE – AND
VICE VERSA.

68

Theory of Types

MOST OF MY
WORK IN LOGIC WAS
DEVOTED TO DEVELOPING
THIS MACHINERY. I CALLED
IT THE “THEORY OF
TYPES”.

WE SHOULD
CONTRAST DIFFERENT
TYPES OF SETS ...

Russell’s paradox used against Frege is
roughly a reformulation of the Liar in the
language of Set Theory. Russell asked us
to consider the set of all sets that are not
members of themselves. The question he
raised was whether this set is a member of
itself. This leads to the familiar pattern: if it
is a member of itself, then it is not a
member of itself; if it is not a member
of itself, then it is a member of
itself. Russell came up with a
complicated logical machinery
to tackle this problem.

SETS WHOSE
MEMBERS ARE OBJECTS,
SETS WHOSE MEMBERS ARE SETS,
AND SO ON. WE CAN GO ON
INDEFINITELY TO HAVE SETS WHOSE
MEMBERS ARE SETS OF SETS
AND SUCH LIKE.

In the same way we can use predicates
that talk about objects and predicates
that talk about predicates, like: “to be
beautiful is dangerous”.
69

Russell’s theory argues that if we prohibit crossover between
types, then his paradox is solved – the problematic set is a set of
sets and as such of a different type than the sets that make it up.
The paradox does not get off the ground because it involves
crossover between types.
Unfortunately, when this solution is applied to the Liar Paradox it
turns out that this potentially infinite solution is not enough. When
Russell tried to analyse “This sentence is false”, he found it
consisted of two sentences ...

2

1

This sentence is false.
The first says of an object
that it is a sentence ...

... and the second says of
the sentence that it is false.

Russell thought that “This is true” is a predicate that says something
about a sentence – i.e., about a predicate and its object.
THE PROBLEM FOR THE
SIMPLE THEORY OF TYPES IS THAT
THE LIAR HAS TWO PREDICATES OF
DIFFERENT TYPES – A SITUATION IT
CANNOT COPE WITH.

Willard Van
Orman Quine
(1908–2000)

I DID FIND A WAY
TO COPE WITH THIS
PROBLEM, BUT ONLY AT
THE COST OF MAKING MY
SYSTEM EVEN MORE
UNWIELDY.

RUSSELL’S NEW SYSTEM
PREVENTED SO MANY CROSSOVERS
BETWEEN TYPES THAT IT BECAME
IMPOSSIBLE TO PROVE EVEN THE
ELEMENTARY PROPOSITIONS OF SET
THEORY USING THAT SYSTEM.
70

Tarski’s Solution to the Liar
Tarski thought that his own distinction between the language
“under study” and the “metalanguage” could neatly take care of
the Liar, because “is true” and “is false” are predicates of the
metalanguage.

IS F

When the liar says “this sentence is false”, he is misapplying the
predicate “is false”. He treats it as being part of the object
language. But it can only really be applied to the metalanguage.

A SENTENCE CANNOT CONTAIN
ITS OWN TRUTH PREDICATE. “THIS
SENTENCE IS FALSE” IS NO MORE A PART OF
THE OBJECT LANGUAGE THAN “SNOW IS
BLANCHE” IS PART OF ENGLISH.

This solution is similar to
Russell’s, as it does not
allow sentences of the
same type to speak of
their own truth value. Just
as there are infinite types,
so with Tarski’s proposal
there are languages to
study languages to study
the metalanguage and so
on indefinitely.

Just as the Liar appeared to be a
problem for Russell, so a paradox like
“The next sentence is false. The last

Tarski. One sentence seems
to belong to both the

the metalanguage for the

“THE NEXT

The Liar remains one of the great unsolved paradoxes.

72

DO YOU KNOW WHAT “HETEROLOGIES” ARE?

THEY ARE WORDS THAT ARE NOT WHAT THEY SAY.
FOR EXAMPLE, “LONG” IS NOT LONG, “BIG” IS NOT
BIG, AND SO ON.

THEN IS THE WORD “HETEROLOGICAL”
HETEROLOGICAL OR NOT?

IF IT’S NOT HETEROLOGICAL, THEN IT IS WHAT IT
SAYS IT IS; BUT THEN IT SAYS IT’S
HETEROLOGICAL.

AND IF IT IS?

THEN IT IS NOT WHAT IT SAYS; BUT THEN AGAIN
IT SAYS IT’S HETEROLOGICAL.

SO IT IS AND IT ISN’T HETEROLOGICAL
– A PARADOX, YOU MIGHT SAY.

Gödel’s Incompleteness Theorem
The most influential of the modern self-referential paradoxes is
Gödel’s Second Incompleteness Theorem. When it was first
published in 1931, few people could understand it. This does not
mean that the ideas behind it are
particularly hard. Its results have
WHEN I WAS STUDYING
had a huge impact on science,
UNDER HILBERT, I HELPED HIM ON
mathematics and philosophy.
Gödel came up with the
ingenious idea of encoding
the statements of logic and
metamathematics as numbers. He
assigned every symbol in Russell’s
logic a number, then inserted the
numbers into a mathematical
formula that generated a unique
number for every possible string of
symbols in this logic.

HIS PROJECT TO FIND CONSISTENCY
PROOFS FOR ARITHMETIC, USING HIS
RECURSIVE METHOD. TO MY SURPRISE,
EARLY IN THE SEARCH, I DISCOVERED
THAT NO SUCH PROOFS COULD
BE PROVIDED.

74

In Gödel’s system we can translate as follows ...

P
112

v
2

¬
1

P
112

This allows Gödel to produce a unique number for this formula.

USING THIS METHOD,
I SHOWED THAT A PARTICULAR
NUMBER WOULD CORRESPOND TO A
FORMULA IN RUSSELL’S FULL SYSTEM
THAT SAYS: “THIS FORMULA IS
UNPROVABLE.”

Once we have arrived at this
formula, we can go one of two ways.
First, suppose this sentence is true –
we have a true statement in
Russell’s logic that cannot be
proven. This means that
Russell’s logic is
incomplete.
Alternatively, if the
sentence is false,
it means that it is
provable – but
then a false
statement is
provable in
Russell’s
logic, so it
is incoherent.

75

The Consequences of Gödel’s Theorem
Neither of these suggestions is very appealing to Russell or
Hilbert, who wanted to construct a system that will produce all
and only true sentences of mathematics. They now faced the
fact that this goal is unachievable in principle.

I HAVE SHOWN THAT
THE BASIC BRANCHES OF
MATHEMATICS MAY BE
FORMALIZED BY A SET OF AXIOMS IN
ACCORDANCE WITH HILBERT’S
PROGRAMME. BUT THE CONCLUSIONS OF
MY THEOREM APPLY TO THEM AS WELL. SO
EITHER BASIC ARITHMETIC IS
INCOMPLETE OR IT IS INCOHERENT –
EITHER ONE TRUE CALCULATION
CANNOT BE PROVEN OR ONE
FALSE ONE CAN.

Gödel’s theorem can be generalized to cover any sufficiently
complex formal language in which there is a certain “order”
among the different sentences. Gödel subsequently went on to
prove that mathematics is essentially incomplete – that no list of
axioms can ever account for all the truths of arithmetic. The
conclusion that there are true sentences of mathematics that
cannot be proven is very alarming for anyone interested in trying
to set mathematics on a secure basis.

76

Gödel put the final nail in the 19th-century dream of deriving all
mathematics from a simple and rigorous set of axioms. Logic is
no longer practised in the hope of grounding mathematics.

IT IS NOT ALL BAD NEWS
FOR THE EVERYDAY PRACTICE OF
MATHEMATICIANS. AS LONG AS THEY SHOW
THAT THEIR SYSTEMS ARE CONSISTENT, AT THE
PRICE OF BEING INCOMPLETE, THEY CAN
CONTINUE TO PRODUCE BY FAR THE GREAT
MAJORITY OF MATHEMATICAL
SENTENCES.

WHILST MY
PROGRAMME WAS
DEVASTATED, MY METHOD
CONTINUED TO BE OF USE IN
FORMALIZING AND AXIOMATIZING NEW
BRANCHES OF MATHEMATICS. I MYSELF
DEVISED A MATHEMATICAL SYSTEM TO
DEAL WITH THE BIZARRE REALM OF
QUANTUM PARTICLES, WHICH THEY
NOW CALL HILBERT SPACES.

77

The “Halting Problem”
Gödel’s theorem shows us something very similar
when applied to computation. Using Gödel’s
numbering system, every formal

COMPUTERS

BASICALLY MY NUMBERING
TECHNIQUE THAT ALLOWS
THEM TO RUN PROGRAMS
WITHIN FORMAL
LOGIC.

This means that Gödel’s incompleteness theorem
applies to computers. The uncomputable numbers
correspond in a way to programs that will never give a
result. Gödel’s incompleteness theorem means that
there cannot be a program using a finite number of
steps to check any program to see whether it will
reach a conclusion or halt. This has become known as
the “halting problem”. Such a program would be
equivalent to a system in which you could consistently
compute all numbers, and that is an impossibility.
78

The Limit of Gödel’s Proof
Despite its wide-ranging ramifications, there are certain things
that Gödel's proof cannot do. It does not absolutely guarantee
that we could not use Hilbert’s method to prove the consistency
and completeness of arithmetic, only that such a proof is not
capable of being represented within arithmetic. This is true, but
nobody to date knows what such a proof would look like, let
alone how to construct one.
It cannot be used to say, as some have tried, that mysterious
intuition must replace cogent proof. Nor is it a proof that there
are inherent limits to human reasoning, since no one knows if
human reasoning falls under Hilbert’s rules.
IT DOES NOT
MEAN THAT WE HAVE
NO HOPE OF
EXPLAINING THOUGHT
IN PHYSICAL
TERMS.

BUT IT DOES
CAST DOUBT ON
THE POSSIBILITY OF
ANY SYSTEMS OF RULES
THAT FORMALIZE ANY
POSSIBLE
SENTENCE.

Gödel’s incompleteness theorem has even made it into first-year
undergraduate ethics lectures.
79

Zeno’s Movement Paradox
The most famous of the non-self-referential paradoxes was also
invented by Zeno of Elea. Zeno wanted to show that movement
was impossible. Every time we see something move, it is our
senses deceiving us. Zeno’s principal argument for this curious
claim was to show that if movement were to exist, it would lead
to a contradiction.

OUR LEGENDARY
HERO ACHILLES WILL NEVER
RUN FAST ENOUGH TO CATCH THAT
TORTOISE. FOR IN ORDER TO CATCH
IT, HE MUST FIRST TRAVEL HALF THE
DISTANCE BETWEEN HIMSELF AND
THE TORTOISE.
THEN HE WOULD
HAVE TO TRAVEL HALF THE
REMAINING DISTANCE; THEN
AGAIN AND AGAIN … TO
INFINITY.
HE WOULD TAKE
AN INFINITE AMOUNT OF
TIME TO REACH THE
TORTOISE.

80

Zeno would claim to have reached
his conclusion from true premises.
Who would deny that to get from A
to B you have to travel half the
distance first? But our senses tell
us that we reach and pass places
all the time. So Zeno concludes
that our senses deceive us. Zeno’s
paradox can be applied to all
types of movement.
SINCE AN ARROW
SHOT TOWARDS A TARGET
FIRST HAS TO COVER HALF THE
DISTANCE, AND THEN HALF THE
REMAINDER, AND THEN HALF THE
REMAINDER AFTER THAT, AND
SO AD INFINITUM ...

THE RESULT IS THAT
ALTHOUGH AN ARROW IS
ALWAYS APPROACHING ITS
TARGET, IT NEVER QUITE GETS
THERE.

So Saint Sebastian
must have died of
fright!

81

An Infinite Sum
Zeno’s Paradox relies on an assumption made by
all mathematicians before Newton and Leibniz.
They assumed that any sum of an infinite number
of positive numbers would be infinite. It is an easy
assumption to make.

A

IF WE TAKE THE
DISTANCE FROM A TO B
AS 1 ...

I CLAIM THAT YOU
WOULD FIRST HAVE TO
WALK HALFWAY.

1/
2

ADD TO THAT THE
REMAINING DISTANCE.

1/
4

AND HALFWAY
AGAIN ...

1/
8

B
The consequence is that we have an infinite sum
of positive quantities 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 … and that,
according to Zeno’s assumption, would be infinite.
We would never get from A to B!
82

A Convergence on Limits
What Newton and Leibniz discovered almost
simultaneously was that often the sum of a positive
number of integers is not infinite. Some infinite calculations
have the property of converging on limits. Which is to say,
with each subsequent addition we get ever closer to a
particular number. Given an infinite number of
calculations, we could eventually arrive at the number.

A

B

UNFORTUNATELY
FOR ZENO, THE SUM
1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 … IS JUST SUCH A
CALCULATION.

1

This is fortuitous, as it means
that it takes exactly the time to
get from A to B that it takes to
get from A to B ... and our
senses are saved.

83

A

IT CAN EASILY BE
SHOWN, USING OUR
METHOD, THAT THE FINAL
SUM OF THIS
CALCULATION IS 1.

IT TOOK 2,000 YEARS,
BUT EVENTUALLY I BEAT
THAT TORTOISE!

How Much is a “Heap”?
The other famous non-self-referential paradox is the Sorites or
Heap paradox. It was much loved by the Stoics who used it to
show the weakness of reason. It relies on the fact that some
words in our language, like “heap”, are vague. In certain
instances, there are no sharp rules to say when they can be
applied correctly.

HERE IS A HEAP OF
SAND.

IF I WERE TO REMOVE ONE GRAIN OF
SAND, WOULD IT STILL BE A HEAP?

YES – WHAT
DIFFERENCE
CAN A
SINGLE
GRAIN OF
SAND
MAKE?

WE NOW HAVE
ONE GRAIN
OF SAND LEFT.
IS IT A HEAP?
HARDLY. YET
AT EACH
STAGE I ONLY
REMOVED A
SINGLE GRAIN
WHICH YOU
AGREED WAS
UNIMPORTANT.

WHAT IF I WERE TO
REMOVE ANOTHER
GRAIN OF SAND,
WOULD IT STILL BE
A HEAP?

OF COURSE;
AND ANOTHER …

The Sorites paradox trades on
the fact that there are no rules
to determine the number of
grains of sand in a heap. It is
a real paradox, because by
following logical steps we
each agree to be true, we are
led to the contradiction that a
single grain of sand both is
and is not a heap.
84

The Challenge to Sets
The Sorites paradox can be applied to more than just grains of
sand. It can be applied to almost anything you can make minute
changes to. Recently the philosopher Peter Unger published a
paper called “I do not exist”. There he performs a Sorites
paradox on himself, removing one cell at a time. The Sorites has
no bearing on formal logic, in which what matters is the pure
manipulation of symbols. But once we try
to apply meaning to those
symbols, this paradox

IF WE DO NOT HAVE A
SOLUTION, THEN THE WHOLE
ATTEMPT BECOMES VERY
QUESTIONABLE.
85

Undermining Logic
Apart from threatening the attempt to use sets to analyse
predicates of our language, the Sorites paradox throws into
doubt the ability of Propositional and Predicate calculus to
describe the way the world is.

THE LAW OF
IDENTITY (a = a) AND THE
LAW OF NON-CONTRADICTION
¬(p&¬p) ARE TWO FUNDAMENTAL
AXIOMS OF OUR SYSTEMS OF
LOGIC. THE SORITES PARADOX
CHALLENGES BOTH.

It challenges the law of identity
because it seems to come up with the
result that something that is a heap is
also not a heap. For the same reason it
also challenges the law of noncontradiction. Unsurprisingly, many
contemporary philosophers and
logicians have become rather upset by
this result.
86

The Fiction of Vague Words
Many possible solutions have been offered. They broadly fall into
three categories. Some suggest that the problem lies with applying
vague concepts to the world. Others think that the vagueness is
only apparent. A few think that the best thing to do is break away
from the constraints of propositional and predicate logic. Frege
thought that there should be no vague terms in logical argument.
For Frege, the business of logic was scientific precision, and vague
words serve only as a useful fiction in everyday speech.

Odysseus is wise
Patrick Stewart is bald.

WE UNDERSTAND BOTH
“ODYSSEUS IS WISE” AND
“PATRICK STEWART IS BALD”. BUT
JUST AS THERE IS NO ODYSSEUS,
SO THERE IS NO PROPERTY OF
BALDNESS.

IN MY PRECISE
LANGUAGE, WE HAVE TO SET
ASIDE BEARERLESS NAMES, AND
SIMILARLY WE HAVE TO SET ASIDE
PREDICATES THAT FAIL TO
ATTRIBUTE EXPLICIT
PROPERTIES.

87

Peter Unger’s
suggestion amounts
to the fact that words
like “people” are also
such useful fictions.

What Do Words “Mean”?
Other contemporary thinkers opt to deny vagueness, or claim
that the vagueness is only due to a lack of knowledge. They
would claim, for example, that a particular number of grains of
sand makes up a heap, but we may not know what it is. They
believe that there is a genuine fact of the matter as to whether
something is or is not a heap.

So the good old laws of logic are in fact true of the world. The
problem lies only with the words and concepts we use to talk
about the world.
This solution to the Sorites paradox suggests that we do not
really know what our words mean, since it is accepted that
knowing what a word means involves knowing how to apply it
correctly. But the solution explicitly denies that we have this sort
of knowledge.
88

Fuzzy Logic
Because none of these solutions is conclusive or unproblematic,
there are thinkers who have bitten the bullet and accepted the
result of the paradox. They renounce the age-old demand that
statements have one of two possible truth values: true or false.
Now we can think of sentences as being “very true”, “fairly true”,
“reasonably false”, “completely false” and so on. Thus a whole
family of logics is created, known collectively as “fuzzy logic”.

THIS HAS THE ADDED
ADVANTAGE OF ALLOWING
US TO DEAL IN COMPARATIVE
TRUTH VALUES. CONSIDER
THESE SHAPES ...

IT IS TRUER TO SAY
OF THE OVAL THAT “IT IS
ROUND” THAN IT IS TO SAY IT
OF THE RECTANGLE, DESPITE
THE FACT THAT NEITHER IS
REALLY ROUND.

With some fuzzy logic, truth may be thought of as a continuous scale:

100%
Completely true

50%
Very true

Fairly true

Fairly false

89

0%
Very false

Completely false

Fuzzy Heaps
Resorting to fuzzy logic is not a solution but a submission to the
paradox. But even if we accept it, we cannot rid ourselves
completely of the Sorites. The truth continuum of fuzzy logic
lends itself to a version of the Sorites paradox.

IF SOMETHING IS VERY TRUE, WHAT
HAPPENS IF IT IS 0.000001% LESS TRUE?

IS IT STILL
VERY TRUE? ...

WE COULD SAY THAT
SOMETHING IS VALID IF IT
PRESERVES COMPLETE
TRUTH OR IF IT
PRESERVES THE SAME
DEGREE OF TRUTH.

THE OTHER
PRESSING ISSUE IS
HOW TO ACCOUNT
FOR VALIDITY IN
FUZZY LOGIC. HOW
CAN WE TELL IF ONE
STATEMENT
FOLLOWS FROM
ANOTHER?

The first suggestion takes us back to where we started.
We can only validly infer that something is true if it
follows from a completely true statement. Whilst the
second option means it is unclear whether we could
ever know the truth of our statements, and so ever
make a valid inference. In short, the Sorites
paradox still keeps sleep from the eyes of
those inclined to wrangle with such problems.
90

Can Logic Escape Paradox?
The history of logic is littered with paradoxes.
It may be seen as a struggle between two
camps – the system-builders and the authors
of paradox. For the most part, the systembuilders are looking for precise ways to
analyse our concepts. To do that, they try to
use logic to derive all true statements in a
clear and precise way. In contrast, a good
paradox
will challenge logic’s ability to do
this by casting doubt on our ability to
distinguish or derive true and false statements
or to provide clear definitions for our
concepts.

TODAY’S SYSTEMS,
DESPITE THEIR TECHNICAL
INGENUITY, ARE ALMOST AS
BESET BY PARADOXES AS THE
LOGIC OF ANCIENT
GREECE.

FOR WHILST
PREDICATE CALCULUS IS
ITSELF FREE OF PARADOXES,
THE MOMENT WE TRY TO USE IT
TO ANSWER QUESTIONS ABOUT
THE WORLD, WE SOON RUN
INTO TROUBLE.

Given these limitations of predicate calculus, it
was only a matter of time before some logicians
tried to move away from it and develop new
systems of logic. Fuzzy logic is but one of
these “non-classical” logics.

91

Non-Classical Logics: Intuitionism
One of the first alternatives to what is now called
“classical logic” came from L.E.J. Brouwer (1881–1966).
He objected to Frege and Russell’s project of reducing
mathematics to logic. He thought that mathematics
rests on basic “intuitions” we have of
what certain basic mathematical
objects (like number and line)
I TRIED TO SHOW
are. His view is hence known
THAT

as “intuitionism”.

The Devil’s Argument
Brouwer concentrated mainly on cases of infinite sets and
sequences. For example, the set of all positive numbers and the
sequence of digits comprising irrational numbers like π and 2.
Brouwer’s argument could be put like this ...
I can logically prove to you that the sequence 666 must appear
somewhere in the extension of any irrational number like π. For
to say that it’s not there, is the same as saying that for all digits of
π, it is not the case that the sequence 666 appears in them. But
that can never be mathematically proved. Even if you fill every
piece of paper in the world with digits of π, there would still be
infinitely more digits that you haven’t checked.

Intuitionistic Logic
Although Brouwer wanted to show that some
mathematical proofs work differently than logic, it was
noticed that Brouwer’s argument could also show that
some branches of mathematics work according to a
different logic. Some even developed such a logic
and tried to show that it is in fact the logic of all
mathematics. They called it “intuitionistic logic”.

FI

THE MAIN THING
ABOUT INTUITIONISTIC
LOGIC IS THAT IT DOESN’T
INCLUDE THE RULE ¬¬p = p,
UNLESS THERE IS A CLEAR
METHOD OF CHECKING
WHETHER ¬¬p IS TRUE.

N

ITE

SET

¬¬p = p

THIS ALLOWS US TO
USE THIS RULE IN CASES OF
FINITE SETS, FOR EXAMPLE, BUT
KEEPS OUT THE CASE OF
INFINITE SETS AND
SEQUENCES.

Intuitionism versus the Reductio Method
An important feature of intuitionistic logic is that in it Leibniz’s
reductio method cannot work. In the reductio method, we prove
a mathematical statement by assuming its opposite and getting
to a contradiction. But the move from “its negation is false” to “it
is true” relies on the law of excluded middle. The reductio
method doesn’t give us a construction of the mathematical
sentence from the axioms of some branch of mathematics, as
mathematics is supposed to work.

WITHOUT GIVING US
THE PROPER PROOF OF THE
SENTENCE, YOU WANT TO SHOW IT
MUST BE TRUE BECAUSE ITS
NEGATION IS FALSE. SAYING THAT
RELIES ON THE LAW THAT ¬¬p = p,
WHICH DOESN’T EXIST IN MY
LOGIC.

THE PROBLEM
IS THAT MANY
FUNDAMENTAL
MATHEMATICAL
STATEMENTS – THAT
EVERYONE WANTS TO
ACCEPT – HAVE ONLY
EVER BEEN PROVED
USING MY REDUCTIO
METHOD.

The Intuitionistic Fad
This problem led to a new mathematical
fad during the1930s, of trying to find
proofs to some basic and frequently used
mathematical sentences using
intuitionistic logic. Many such proofs were
found. Departments of mathematics and
philosophy were born and new academic
divisions formed. Even Hilbert’s formal
methods, though being rivals to
intuitionistic logic, were designed to use
only approved intuitionistic procedures.
Until eventually, Gödel got interested.

SO AS FAR AS
CONSISTENCY IS THE
MEASURE FOR
MATHEMATICAL SYSTEMS,
INTUITIONISTIC ONES ARE
NOT SIGNIFICANTLY
DIFFERENT FROM
CLASSICAL ONES.

USING
HILBERT’S
METHODS, I SHOWED
THAT CLASSICAL
FORMAL ARITHMETIC IS
CONSISTENT IF AN
INTUITIONISTIC
ONE IS.

Interest in the debate has gone down a
bit since then, but the basic notion – that
we require a constructive proof to be sure
a statement is true – still has its modern
supporters among logicians,
mathematicians, scientists and
philosophers.

96

Addressing Some
Old Problems
At around the same time,
interest was sparked in an idea
that a Polish mathematician
named Jan Lukasiewicz
(1897–1956) published in
1920. It did not stir much
response outside Poland for
over a decade. Lukasiewicz
addressed some old problems
that were known to exist in
logic from Aristotle to Russell.

I ALREADY
NOTICED THAT LOGIC IS
ILL-EQUIPPED TO DEAL WITH
SUCH WORDS AS “POSSIBLE”
AND “NECESSARY”, AND WITH
STATEMENTS ABOUT THE
FUTURE.
HOW CAN WE
DECIDE, AFTER ALL, WHAT
THE TRUTH VALUE OF
“IT WILL SNOW ON BIG BEN IN
A THOUSAND YEARS’
TIME” IS?
97

The Value of Possible
Lukasiewicz wanted a logical system that
could incorporate and deal with these
elements of language. To do that, he
designed a logic which had three truth
values: false, true, and one that he
thought of as “possible”. Any statement in
Lukasiewicz’s logic can have the third
truth value, as well as be false or true.

BECAUSE OF THAT,
I HAD TO DECIDE NEW RULES
FOR ALL THE LOGICAL
CONNECTIVES. WHAT, FOR
EXAMPLE, IS THE TRUTH VALUE
OF p&q WHEN p IS TRUE
AND q IS POSSIBLE?

TRUE
p

POSSIBLE
q

98

FALSE

Truth Values as Numbers
To solve this problem, it’s easier to think of truth values as
numbers. True and false have also been frequently represented
as 1 and 0.

I DECIDED TO
TREAT THE THIRD
TRUTH VALUE AS
THOUGH IT WAS
1/2.

1

1/2

p

q

0

Using numbers, the truth value of p&q would be the smallest
between the truth values of p and q.
Thus, if p is 1 and q is 1/2, then p&q is also 1/2.
The value of pvq is similarly the biggest among the truth values
of p and q, so that if p is 0 and q is 1/2 then the value of pvq
would also be 1/2.
The value of ¬p would be 1 minus (the value of p), so that if p is
possible (1/2), its negation is also possible.

99

The Possible and Non-Contradiction
As a result, in Lukasiewicz’s logic neither the law of excluded
middle nor the law of non-contradiction works. It is false to say
that either p is true or not-p is true, for p can also be “possible”.
For the same reason, it is also false to say that p and ¬p cannot
have the same truth value.
HOWEVER, THE LAW
OF NON-CONTRADICTION
WORKS IN MY LOGIC IN A
DIFFERENT WAY.

IT MIGHT BE PUT
LIKE THIS:

SO FUNNILY
ENOUGH, IT CAN BE
PROVED IN MY
LOGIC THAT...

... WHICH
WORKS WELL FOR ALL
TRUTH VALUES OF p.
IN THIS SENSE, IT IS VERY
DIFFERENT FROM
BROUWER’S LOGIC.
100

Despite the fact that two fundamental rules of classical logic do
not apply in Lukasiewicz’s logic, it is perfectly consistent and can
be used just as well as Russell’s logic. When the usual suspects
became aware of Lukasiewicz’s invention, it was quickly shown
that his definitions of logical connectives could apply to create
logics with any number of truth values from three to infinity.
All you need to do if you want, for example, to have a logic with 7
truth values is to give each truth value the numerical value of 1/6.
You’ll have the truth values ...

0

1
6

2
6

3
6

( 12 )

4
6

5
6

6
6

(1)
i.e., seven truth values in total.

IT IS ENTIRELY
UP TO YOU TO DECIDE
WHAT THESE VALUES
MEAN.

AS FAR AS LOGIC IS
CONCERNED, LUKASIEWICZ’S
RULES FOR LOGICAL
CONNECTIVES WILL WORK
PERFECTLY.

101

From Classical to Fuzzy Logic
Brouwer and Lukasiewicz initiated the modern period in logic.
Logic has evolved rapidly ever since. Now we have dozens of
systems of logic that are of interest to someone somewhere.
Logic was analysed into its simplest parts using tools that came
from algebra, and then put
together again to please any
WITH LUKASIEWICZ,
taste and fashion.
“MANY-VALUED LOGIC”
Everything that happened
WAS BORN, WHICH HAS
in logic from Aristotle to the
RECENTLY ALSO EARNED THE
1930s was put in a single
MORE FUNKY NAME OF
package – classical logic.
“FUZZY LOGIC”.

LUKASIEWICZ’S
ORIGINAL IDEA TO USE
HIS LOGIC TO DEAL WITH THE
WORD “POSSIBLE” DID NOT
CATCH ON, BUT MANY OTHER
APPLICATIONS WERE LATER
FOUND FOR FUZZY
LOGIC.

102

Electronic “Possible” States
One important application of fuzzy logic is in the field
of electronic machines. Remember the way many
electronic devices work. These are typically devices
that use yes/no or on/off switches, modelled on
propositional calculus with the traditional two truth
values, true and false. But
there are machines that
might use switches with
more than two possible
positions.

THE KEYS IN THIS
KEYBOARD ARE SIMPLY
ON/OFF SWITCHES. IF I
PRESS ONE, A SOUND
COMES OUT.

THIS OTHER ONE IS
MUCH BETTER, WITH KEYS
THAT HAVE MORE THAN TWO
POSSIBLE STATES. THE SOUND
THEY MAKE CHANGES AND
BECOMES LOUDER THE HARDER
I PRESS THEM, LIKE A REAL
PIANO.

When machines
use switches with
more than two
possible states, they can
be modelled using fuzzy
logic, just as easily as
simpler ones can be modelled
with propositional calculus.
103

The Fuzzy Logic Search Engine
Another important implication of fuzzy logic is in the field of AI.
Suppose we want a smart information retrieval system, like an
improved Web search engine. The more an engine can
recognize what you are looking for from the list of words you give
it, the better it will be.
IF WE USE
CLASSICAL
PROPOSITIONAL CALCULUS IN
OUR SEARCH ENGINE, THEN
SITES EITHER MATCH THE WORDS
YOU GIVE THE ENGINE OR THEY
DON’T. EVERY SMALL VARIATION IN
SPELLING COUNTS AS A
NON-MATCH.

The Fuzzy Logical Machine
In general, fuzzy logic is a better tool than classical logic when it
comes to pattern recognition, rather than finding 100% matches
between things. Using fuzzy logic, we can get machines that tell
when one thing is similar to another. This is an important skill with
many applications in AI, such as word recognition, object
recognition and so on.

THE NEURAL NET IS A
DEVICE THAT DOES BETTER THAN A
NORMAL COMPUTER IN THE FIELD OF
PATTERN RECOGNITION. WHILE A NORMAL
COMPUTER IS EFFECTIVELY A CLASSICAL
LOGICAL MACHINE, A NEURAL NET IS IN
FACT A FUZZY LOGICAL MACHINE.

THE IDEA OF
THE “NEURAL NET”
IS DISCUSSED ON
PAGES 161–5.

Logic in the Quantum World
The 20th-century marriage of logic and algebra led to some
other strange logics with important scientific and technological
applications.

IN THE 1920s I HAD TO INVENT A
SPECIAL MATHEMATICAL TOOL TO EXPRESS THE
PHYSICAL BEHAVIOUR OF PARTICLES LIKE ELECTRONS IN
QUANTUM MECHANICS. THE QUANTUM WORLD IS A VERY
STRANGE WORLD AND NEEDS JUST AS STRANGE
MATHEMATICAL MODELS TO
DESCRIBE IT.
SEVERAL DECADES

By then algebra and logic were so
close that if we had an algebraic
formulation of quantum mechanics,
we could also have a logical one.

LATER, MATHEMATICIANS
FOUND AN ALGEBRAIC
FORMULATION OF THE SPECIALLY
DESIGNED “HILBERT SPACES”.

106

The Distributive Law
of Quantum Logic
Quantum logic emerged in the 1960s. The idea
is that the quantum universe – which scientists
still find hard to understand and describe –
works according to a logic of its own. As the
philosopher Hilary Putnam (b.1926) said, this
logic is very different from classical logic which
comes from human language and reasoning.

IN QUANTUM LOGIC
THERE ARE TWO POSSIBLE
TRUTH VALUES TO ANY SENTENCE,
AS IN CLASSICAL LOGIC. THE MAIN
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CLASSICAL AND
QUANTUM LOGIC CONCERNS THE
DISTRIBUTIVE LAW, RATHER THAN ANY
OF THE FUNDAMENTAL LAWS OF LOGIC
LIKE THE EXCLUDED MIDDLE OR
NON-CONTRADICTION.

THE DISTRIBUTIVE LAW
OF LOGIC STATES THAT

p&(qvr) = (p&q)v(p&r) .
107

How Quantum Logic Works
The distributive law of classical logic
works like this ...

GIVE ME A PIECE OF
CHOCOLATE CAKE,
PLEASE.
WE HAVE CHOCOLATE
CAKE WITH EITHER
CHERRIES OR ALMONDS.

YOU MEAN YOU HAVE
CHOCOLATE CAKE WITH
CHERRIES, OR CHOCOLATE
CAKE WITH ALMONDS.

In quantum logic this simple rule does not work.
The baker would still somehow have chocolate
cake with either cherries or almonds, but when
you check, you may find neither chocolate cake
with cherries nor chocolate cake with almonds.

Confused? Now you know why physicists are
going on about it so much.

108

Logic by Experiment
The invention of quantum logic has led Putnam to
claim that the question which logic applies to the
world is an empirical one and can only be
answered by experiment. Putnam claimed that
quantum mechanics is really the discovery that
the subatomic world works according to a
different logic than the one we
are used to in the everyday
I BECAME AWARE THAT
world. Since then,
TO BE ABLE TO READ THE
Putnam had to rethink
RESULTS OF AN EXPERIMENT AND
a little.
KNOW WHICH LOGIC IT SUPPORTS, WE
MUST ALREADY START WITH SOME
KIND OF REASONING. SO NOT ALL
LOGIC IS GAINED FROM
OBSERVATION.

Classical Logic

Fuzzy Logic

I STILL BELIEVE THAT
THERE ARE FACTS IN THE
WORLD THAT DETERMINE WHICH
LOGIC IT IS APPROPRIATE TO USE
IN EACH CASE, AND THAT NO
LOGIC IS BETTER THAN
ANOTHER.
Quantum Logic

109

Quantum logic may not
destroy the whole basis
behind our belief in human
reasoning, but it has
applications that take us
almost into the realms of
science fiction.

1
TRUE

0
FALSE

The way we understand the
world today, if we compute
using single atoms, we are
using tiny quantum computers.
The logic that will be the best
model for the actions of such
computers would likewise be
quantum logic. Although this is
technology at its birth, there
may soon come a day when
many of our most complicated
calculations will happen by the
weird laws of quantum logic.

SCIENTISTS TODAY
HAVE SOME SUCCESS IN USING
SINGLE ATOMS AS DIGITAL BITS.
THEY CAN EXIST IN ONE OF TWO
STATES, AND THERE’S NO HARM IN
TAKING THESE STATES TO REPRESENT
1 AND 0, OR TRUE AND FALSE. THIS IS
OF COURSE THE ULTIMATE VISION IN
TERMS OF MINIMIZATION,
SPEED AND EFFICIENCY.

110

Logic and Science
If the only applications of logic were argument and the
foundation of mathematics, then it would be a rather limited tool.
However, the whole of modern science involves the application
of logical and mathematical tools. Frege’s logic was in fact
designed to help create a rigorous scientific language. But the
links between logic and science go back much further than that.

I DID NOT
THINK MUCH OF
MATHEMATICS, SO MY
SCIENCE DID NOT RELY ON
PRECISE MEASUREMENT OR
EXPERIMENTATION. I
CONCLUDED THAT HEAVENLY
BODIES MOVE IN CIRCLES
OUT OF THEIR LOVE OF
GOD.

Unfortunately, trying to
predict the motion of
the planets using this
idea proved very
difficult. Eventually in
the 2nd century AD,
Ptolemy started to add
more circles to
Aristotle’s system to
account for the
movement of mass.

The Copernican Revolution
Ptolemy’s additions helped matters for a
while, but Mars kept running out of its
predicted orbit. This was dealt with by
adding an ever increasing number of
circles, until the Copernican revolution in
the middle of the 15th century. Copernicus
suggested predictions would be simplified
if the earth went in circles around the sun.

THE CHURCH HAD
ALREADY GIVEN ITS APPROVAL
TO THE ARISTOTELIAN SYSTEM.
MY SUGGESTION OFFENDED
AGAINST THE INFALLIBILITY OF
THE POPE.

Copernicus's heresy inspired people like Galileo and Kepler.
Galileo thought that the controversy should be resolved by
experiment. Using a brilliant bit of deduction, he concluded that
if the earth moved round the sun, it would affect the motion of a
pendulum. It does.
112

Galileo’s Revolution
Galileo insisted that the
phenomena of nature must be
subject to careful observation
and rigorous measurement. We
should not rely on the authority of
the past but on quantified
observation. For him,
“mathematics is the language of
nature”. Galileo revived Plato’s
idea that nature is governed by
mathematical laws.

I DISCOVERED MY
LAWS OF MOTION BY
LOOKING AT THE
MATHEMATICAL
REGULARITIES IN
EXPERIMENTS.

HIS RESULTS
FORM THE EARLIEST
START TO NEWTONIAN
MECHANICS.

Galileo was forced to
retract by the Church
and spent the rest of
his life in seclusion. But
the cries of scientific
revolution were beyond
stopping now. Soon the
Aristotelian world came
tumbling down on itself.

113

Methods of Deduction and Induction
Galileo’s methods became the methodology of science
developed by the philosophers Francis Bacon (1561–1626)
and René Descartes.

ONCE WE HAVE
THESE LAWS, WE CAN
DEDUCE FROM THEM TO
SEE WHAT SHOULD
HAPPEN. WE CAN THEN
PERFORM THE EXPERIMENT
TO SEE IF THE
PREDICTION IS
RIGHT.

IN SCIENCE,
FIRST WE PERFORM
EXPERIMENTS, THEN WE
GENERALIZE FROM THE
EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
TO ARRIVE AT
NATURAL LAWS.

Descartes and Bacon represent two forms of reasoning –
deduction and induction. Deduction is the method used to show
that one theory follows from another. Induction is the
method of inferring a general rule from a few cases.

THIS RAVEN IS BLACK.
THAT RAVEN IS BLACK …

Problems with Induction
In deduction, the truth of the
conclusion follows from the truth of the
premise. In an induction we can say no
such thing. The fact that the two ravens
are black does not contradict the fact
that there is a white raven in Japan. But
the general rule that “all ravens are
black” is inconsistent with the
existence of a white raven.

THEREFORE THE
TRUTH OF THE
SUPPORTING CLAIMS DOES
NOT LOGICALLY GUARANTEE
THE TRUTH OF THE
CONCLUSION.
THIS POSES A
PROBLEM FOR THE USE OF
INDUCTION IN SCIENCE TO
PRODUCE A GUARANTEED
RESULT.

116

Hume’s Fork
Although we are able to use
induction with considerable
success, nevertheless its
application is questionable.
The Scottish philosopher
David Hume (1711–76)
has been credited with
the idea that our use of
induction is unjustifiable.

Justify
induction
TO JUSTIFY
INDUCTION WE HAVE
TO CHOOSE BETWEEN
TWO OPTIONS. THE FIRST IS
TO USE DEDUCTION, BUT THE
TRUTH OF INDUCTION
CANNOT BE DEDUCED
FROM THE AXIOMS
OF LOGIC.

This has been
known ever since
as Hume’s Fork.

Use
deduction

Dead End

Use
induction

WE CANNOT USE
INDUCTION EITHER, BECAUSE
THAT MEANS THAT OUR OWN
JUSTIFICATION WOULD BE CIRCULAR,
AND THE JUSTIFICATION WOULD
NOT GUARANTEE OUR USE OF
INDUCTION.

117

Nomological Deduction
Hume thought that inductive inference is a psychological fact
about human beings. Once we have been burnt, we will avoid
putting our hand in the fire from then on. We “infer” by
experience.

THIS IS
EXACTLY THE
PROBLEM. USING
INDUCTION SEEMS
TERRIBLY
SENSIBLE.

BUT OUR USE OF
IT CANNOT BE
JUSTIFIED.

Attempts to ground our use of induction have not proved
wholly conclusive. With the rise of the Vienna Circle, serious
doubt was placed on
the idea that science
is truly inductive.

THE IDEA IS THAT
SCIENCE PROPOSES GENERAL
LAWS FROM WHICH PARTICULAR
RESULTS CAN BE DEDUCED.

INSTEAD, THE IDEA
OF “NOMOLOGICAL
DEDUCTION” ROSE TO
PROMINENCE.

Rather than believe that prediction and explanation require
separate methodologies – one inductive and one deductive – we let
deduction do all the work. We see a phenomenon, then come up
with a law that may explain it causally. We then deduce what else
follows from this law and seek empirical confirmation or falsification.
118

The nomological model began with
the philosopher John Stuart Mill
(1806–73). He thought that science
was a division of logic and that
inductive inferences were nothing
but empirical generalizations.
Confidence in these
generalizations increases the more
they are empirically confirmed as
opposed to alternatives. But we
are never completely certain of
their conclusions. Common to all
inductive inferences is the belief
that everything in nature must have
a cause or a condition that is both
necessary and sufficient to cause
its existence. We can discover
both kinds by generalization from
observation.

A NECESSARY CONDITION
MUST BE FOUND ALONG WITH
WHAT IT CAUSES ...
FOR EXAMPLE,
CLOUDS ARE NECESSARY FOR
RAIN. WE CAN FIND THIS OUT BY
TRYING TO FIND CASES OF RAIN
WITHOUT CLOUDS. IF WE CANNOT,
THIS SUPPORTS THE CLAIM.

A sufficient condition is one
that cannot exist without its
effect – like fire with heat. Can
we have a case of fire without
heat?

119

Induction by
Generalization
The work of the scientist
is thus similar to the work
of a chemist distilling
some substance. By
careful use of induction,
deduction and elimination
of candidates, the
scientist eventually
retains a few necessary
and sufficient conditions
for any phenomenon. The
more experiments are
made, the more the
scientist can be sure of
finding the correct
causes for a certain
effect.

120

I THOUGHT THAT
MATHS AND LOGIC
THEMSELVES ARE NOTHING
BUT EMPIRICAL
GENERALIZATIONS, REACHED
BY USING A METHOD WE ARE
VERY SURE OF.
EVERYTHING WE
KNOW IS BY INDUCTION.
SO, HUME’S FORK DOES NOT
ARISE AS THE SPLIT BETWEEN
INDUCTION AND DEDUCTION
IS ERODED.

121

Hume claimed that we cannot
use deduction to justify
induction. But Mill argues that
deduction itself is only thought
to work because of inducing
generalizations from our
experience. Hume cannot use
deductive reasoning to
undermine induction because
that form of reasoning itself
rests on induction.

For Galileo, mathematics is the language
of nature that can eventually discover the
mathematical laws of nature. Mill instead
considers maths another form of
generalization. His idea is that science
moves to ever more general rules that
predict ever more accurately.

NEWTONIAN
MECHANICS WAS A GREAT
ACHIEVEMENT BECAUSE IT
PREDICTED ALL MOVEMENTS
AND FORCES WITH FOUR
SIMPLE RULES.

122

FROM THEM
I COULD DERIVE ALL THE
GREAT LAWS THAT PRECEDED
ME – GALILEO’S LAW OF
MOTION AND KEPLER’S
ACCOUNT OF THE MOVEMENT
OF THE PLANETS, FOR
EXAMPLE.

Mill’s view of mathematics and logic is
quite original and unique. Mill thought
that the certainty with which we hold
mathematical and logical statements like
1+1=2 and ¬(p&¬p) is due to the huge
number of empirical confirmations we
have of them. Philosophers had for a
long time tried to explain the supposedly
necessary truth of
mathematics and
THIS SHOT
logic. Mill claimed that
ALWAYS WORKED
there is nothing to
BEFORE.
explain. These are not
special statements
but just more widely
confirmed ones.
123

Laws or Empirical Predictions
Philosophers have never been totally convinced by Mill's
empirical justification for mathematics and logic. The problem is
that the statements of mathematics – e.g., (2+2=4) – seem to
behave as laws, not simply as predictions that, for example, if I
put two and two apples together I will have four apples.

STRANGE, I HAD
TWO APPLES IN THE
BOWL, THEN ADDED TWO
MORE, BUT NOW THERE
ARE THREE APPLES
THERE!
PERHAPS THIS IS A
CASE WHERE YOUR
GENERALIZATIONS FAIL
YOU?

124

IT SEEMS FAR
MORE LIKELY THAT HE
STOLE ONE OF THE
APPLES!

The rules of mathematics do not predict
future events, but rather regulate what we
take to be rational. Whenever we find a case
that seems to falsify the rules of mathematics
we always look for another rational
explanation. There is just no case where we
would give in and agree that the rules of
maths are wrong in some cases.

It is also hard to see how
such modern ideas as
imaginary numbers and
geometry with more than
three dimensions can be
generalizations from
experience, since we never
find these things in the real
world.

125

The Raven Paradox
The deductive nomological method was modernized by Karl
Hempel (1902–97) of the Vienna Circle. He described science as
looking for general laws based on causation which would
explain all and only the phenomena observed in experience. But
he soon came to see problems with this model.

IF WE HAVE A
GENERAL RULE OF THE
FORM “ALL Fs ARE Gs” (ALL MEN
ARE MORTAL), AND A STATEMENT
OF THE FORM Fa (SOCRATES IS A
MAN), THEN WE MAY CONCLUDE
Ga (SOCRATES IS A
MORTAL).

A LAW OF THIS
FORM IS LOGICALLY
EQUIVALENT TO THE LAW
THAT ALL NON-Gs ARE NOT F
(EVERYTHING THAT IS
IMMORTAL IS NOT A
MAN).

If finding a man who is mortal confirms the
law, then finding something that is not a
man and is immortal also confirms the law.
Armed with this, Hempel came up with a
problem known as “the raven paradox”...
126

TAKE IT FROM ME
THAT ALL RAVENS
ARE BLACK!
AND HERE IS THE
PROOF ...

1:
ALL RAVENS ARE
BLACK MEANS THAT
ANYTHING THAT IS NOT
BLACK IS NOT A
RAVEN.
2:
NOW LOOK AT MY
SHOES. THEY ARE NOT
BLACK AND THEY ARE
NOT RAVENS.
3:
THEREFORE, THEY
CONFIRM THE RULE
THAT ALL RAVENS ARE
BLACK.

This is not a problem of logic but a problem
posed by logic.
We could in theory prove that all ravens are
black by checking that everything in the
universe that is not black is also not a raven.
But as a methodology of science it clearly will
not do, for it takes a pair of white shoes as
confirming the law that all ravens are black,
as much as a black raven does. The problem
is one of irrelevance: even if we knew that all
tennis shoes are white we can see no way
that this affects the colour of ravens.

127

A Problem of Cause and Effect
Another problem with Hempel’s nomological account is that it
does not distinguish between cause and effect. For example, the
observation that a certain reading on a barometer is correlated
with rain might equally well confirm the view that the presence of
rain “causes” the reading of the barometer – or that the reading
of the barometer “causes” the rain.

A GOOD
SCIENTIFIC METHOD
MUST TAKE ACCOUNT
OF THE DIRECTION OF
CAUSE AND EFFECT,
BECAUSE NO ONE
SERIOUSLY BELIEVES
THAT BAROMETERS
CAUSE RAIN.

WHAT WE HAVE
HERE IS A
CONJUNCTION OF TWO
OBSERVATIONS: THE READING
ON THE BAROMETER AND THE
FACT THAT IT IS RAINING
EQUALLY WELL CONFIRM THE
FOLLOWING
ARGUMENTS ...

1. Every time the

According to

method, both

128

Popper’s Answer
to Hempel

LOGICALLY
SPEAKING, TO SAY THAT
IF F IS A NATURAL LAW, THEN
G WILL HAPPEN, IS EQUIVALENT
TO SAYING THAT IF G DID NOT
HAPPEN THEN F IS NOT A NATURAL
LAW. BUT IN TERMS OF OUR ABILITY
TO CONFIRM THEM, THERE IS AN
IMPORTANT DIFFERENCE.

An idea of cause and effect
is not enough to save the
nomological model. Today
almost no one believes in
nomological deduction. The
idea of the confirmation of a
particular law by a
particular observation has
fallen by the wayside. One
alternative suggestion came
from Karl Popper.

THE FIRST
FORMULATION REQUIRES
US TO CHECK ALL Gs. THIS IS
PRACTICALLY IMPOSSIBLE AS IT
REQUIRES US TO CHECK
EVERYTHING THAT HAS
HAPPENED AND WILL EVER
HAPPEN.
BUT A SINGLE
CASE WHERE G HAS
NOT HAPPENED IN
RELEVANT CONDITIONS IS
ENOUGH TO CONVINCE
US THAT F IS NOT A
LAW.

Popper went on to make this
the basis of his scientific
methodology. According to
Popper, the proper way to do
science is not to look for
confirmation of our theories,
but rather to try to disconfirm
them.
By getting rid of the problem
of confirmation, Popper
thought the problem of
induction was solved and
science was based on solid
logical ground.
129

Popper’s Disconfirmation Theory
If a theory is disconfirmed in a particular case, then we reject it
by a deduction very similar to the reductio method.
Popper’s suggestion corresponds to the way that scientists
actually work. Consider this example that ushered out Newtonian
physics ...

ASSUME THAT
NEWTONIAN PHYSICS
IS TRUE. WE SHOULD
THEREFORE BE ABLE TO
DETECT LIGHT MOVING
AT DIFFERENT
SPEEDS.

130

FROM
EXPERIMENTS WE HAVE
NOT FOUND LIGHT TO
MOVE AT DIFFERENT
SPEEDS. THEREFORE
NEWTONIAN PHYSICS IS
NOT TRUE.

When a theory is rejected, the
race begins for a new theory
that can account for all the
results of the old theory and
explain the new empirical
data. If we end up with two
theories that can account for
the same data, then we should
choose the simpler one.

SCIENCE KEEPS
ON UNCOVERING THE
UNKNOWN, AS EVERY
THEORY IS REPLACED BY A
THEORY THAT EXPLAINS
MORE FACTS.

ONCE WE HAVE
SETTLED ON A NEW
THEORY, THEN THE
EFFORT TO DISCONFIRM
BEGINS AGAIN.

131

The Probability of Viable Theory
Popper’s disconfirmation or “falsifiability” theory displaces
induction from its central role in the methodology of science. This
means that all the worries about justification of induction and
Hempel’s worries about confirmation may be avoided.
As it is the job of a theory to account for all previous
observations and make accurate predictions where previous
theories failed, so a new theory also has to explain more. As
science develops, its theories move away from common sense
and become more and more improbable.
A THEORY THAT
EXPLAINS FIVE FACTS
HAS A LARGER CHANCE
OF BEING CORRECT THAN A
THEORY THAT EXPLAINS TEN
FACTS, SIMPLY BECAUSE IT
DEALS WITH FEWER
EVENTS THAT CAN BE
FALSIFIED.

Theory 1

AS SCIENCE
PROGRESSES AND
THEORIES ACCOUNT
FOR EVER MORE FACTS,
SO THE PROBABILITY OF
ITS THEORIES BEING
CORRECT WILL
DECREASE.

Theory 2

132

For a while, Popper’s idea
won a large number of
converts, until Willard Van
Orman Quine (1908–2000)
published the paper “Two
Dogmas of Empiricism” in
1951.
Popper’s view was that an
experimental result can
falsify a particular scientific
theory. For example, the
observed orbit of the planet
Mercury falsifies Newton's
law of universal gravitation.

SURELY THE OBSERVED
ORBIT OF MERCURY CAN ONLY
FALSIFY NEWTON’S THEORY IF THE
OBSERVATION IS CORRECT ...

... IF WE GOT THE
LAWS OF OPTICS
CORRECT ...

... IF THERE IS NO
UNKNOWN INTERFERENCE
BETWEEN HERE AND MERCURY,
AND SO ON AND SO FORTH.

YES?

SO INSTEAD OF ONE THEORY
UNDER SUSPICION, YOU HAVE A HOST OF
QUESTIONABLE ASSUMPTIONS. EACH ONE OF
THEM COULD IN PRINCIPLE BE FALSIFIED BY
EXPERIMENTAL DISCONFIRMATION. SO HOW
DO YOU KNOW WHICH IS THE FALSE
ONE?
ERR??!!
133

Quine’s “Web of Belief”
There is nothing in logic to say why, in Quine’s view, we should
reject Newtonian mechanics and not the laws of optics. When a
collection of statements leads to a contradiction, at least one of
them must be false, but logic does not tell us how to find out
which. To say that the laws of optics have been observed time
after time does not help, for it is logically possible that our faith in
the measurements is misplaced.

TAKE THIS IDEA TO
ITS EXTREME AND IT SAYS
THAT ANY CASE OF
“FALSIFICATION” POTENTIALLY
THREATENS NOT ONLY THE
THEORY IN QUESTION BUT ALSO
OUR ENTIRE SET OF
BELIEFS.

THERE IS NO WAY
LOGICALLY TO DERIVE
WHICH BELIEFS LEAD TO
THE FALSE
CONCLUSION.
134

Quine’s criticism presents the question: how is our
belief that “the countryside is pretty” to have any
influence or bearing on the question of Newtonian
mechanics?

ALL OUR BELIEFS
ARE CONNECTED AND
FORM A WHOLE. I CALL
THIS THE “WEB OF
BELIEF”.

Quine thinks that the
web only touches
experience on the
outside, but it is the
web as a whole that
is measured against
experience.
135

Alterations to the “Web”
Changes to our certain beliefs at the heart of the
web will have repercussions throughout the web,
whilst changes to the softer outer regions will
have less impact on the rest of the web. A major
change will occur if our core beliefs are
challenged – e.g., the conversion of St Paul to
Christianity.

MOST OF MY
WEB HAD TO BE
READJUSTED.

BUT ONLY A MINOR
CHANGE OCCURRED
WHEN BLACK SWANS WERE
DISCOVERED IN
AUSTRALIA.

Quine states: “The totality of our so-called
knowledge or beliefs, from the most casual
matters of geography and law to the profoundest
laws of atomic physics or even pure mathematics
and logic, is a manmade fabric which impinges on
experience only along the edges ... A conflict with
experience at the periphery occasions
readjustments in the innermost part of the web.”

136

When any of our own beliefs faces a falsification by experience,
it is the web as a whole that is challenged. According to Quine,
we try to make as few alterations as possible to accommodate a
new experience. So we try to change the soft parts of the web
rather than the hard parts.

WE CHOSE TO
REJECT NEWTONIAN
MECHANICS RATHER THAN
ANYTHING ELSE BECAUSE WE
FOUND IT INVOLVED FEWER
ALTERATIONS TO THE WEB
AS A WHOLE.

E=MC

NONETHELESS,
THE LAWS OF LOGIC
ARE POTENTIALLY
REVISABLE.

137

Insufficient Evidence
The result of this web of belief is that science is
“underdetermined”, which is to say that there is insufficient
evidence to guarantee logically the truth of our scientific beliefs.
This is because to derive the truth or falseness of any statement,
we require a host of hidden premises effectively describing the
whole of our web of belief. As Quine is at pain to emphasize, the
web only touches experience at the outside. Experience teaches
us very little, most of it is made up by us.

A SCIENTIFIC
STATEMENT IS TAKEN
TO BE TRUE IF IT CAN
ACCOUNT FOR OUR
EXPERIENCE WHILST
MAKING MINIMAL
CHANGES TO OUR WEB
AS A WHOLE.

IF WE HAD A
RADICALLY DIFFERENT
WEB OF BELIEF, LIKE
ARISTOTLE'S, THEN IT MIGHT BE
THAT COMPLETELY DIFFERENT
STATEMENTS WOULD DO THE JOB
OF ACCOUNTING FOR AN
EXPERIENCE WITH MINIMAL
REPERCUSSIONS.

138

Even the basic question of what things there are in the world can
only be answered in the light of the totality of our other beliefs.

PHYSICAL OBJECTS
THEMSELVES ARE NOTHING
MORE THAN CONVENIENT MYTHS
THAT DO THE JOB OF EXPLAINING
AND PREDICTING
EXPERIENCE.

“Physical objects are conceptually imported into the situation as
convenient intermediaries – not by definition in terms of
experience, but simply as irreducible posits
comparable, epistemologically, to the gods of
Homer. Let me interject that for my part I do, qua
lay physicist, believe in physical objects and not
in Homer’s gods; and I consider it a scientific
error to believe otherwise. But in point of
epistemological footing the physical objects and
the gods differ only in degree and not in kind.”

139

Quine’s Relativism
Quine’s idea inspired a number
of people to give up any hope
of arriving at objective truths
about the world through
science. What arose was
relativism about science.

THE COMMON FEATURE
OF RELATIVISM IS THAT IT
PERCEIVES THE SUCCESS OF
SCIENTIFIC THEORIES TO BE RELATIVE
TO AN ELEMENT OTHER THAN
OBJECTIVE TRUTH.

Quine’s idea challenges the
method of choosing between
theories “in simplicity”. What
makes one theory simpler than
the other? Instead of simplicity,
philosophers have suggested
that we choose between rival
theories on grounds as diverse
as politics and financial gain –
or pragmatic advantages and
aesthetic preference.
140

Feyerabend’s Denial of
Scientific Method
The most extreme form of this view
was voiced by the “anarchist”
philosopher of science Paul
Feyerabend (1924–94) who denies the
existence of any scientific method.

EVERY CULTURE
CREATES A THEORY
THAT FITS ITS AESTHETIC
AND MORAL
CHARACTER.

141

Davidson’s Reply to Quine
Donald Davidson had significant doubts
about rejecting scientific method. His
opposition starts with Quine’s belief that logic
is in principle revisable.

IN ORDER TO
KNOW HOW TO
CHANGE OUR WEB,
WE SHOULD BE ABLE
TO TELL WHAT WOULD
FOLLOW FROM A
POSSIBLE CHANGE
IN THE WEB.
HOW ELSE DO
WE KNOW THAT
OUR CHANGE WILL
NOT CONFLICT WITH
EXPERIENCE? IN SHORT,
WE MUST HAVE SOME
SORT OF PROOF
THEORY.

This means that not only can we not
avoid some sort of logic, but also that
this proof theory cannot itself be
revisable. For if we could change the
method of proof, then we would have no
way of telling what the consequences
might be. So, at the very least, the web
must have an unchangeable core.
142

The Presentation of Truth
Davidson’s complaint with relativism goes
further. If our web is genuinely to be a
“web of belief”, then we must assume that
it aims at truth. To believe something and
to believe that it is true amounts to the
same thing. All webs must share a
common ground of truth.

TRUTH IS
NOT PART OF
THE CHANGEABLE
WEB, BUT PART OF
ITS “HARD EDGES”,
SO TO SPEAK.

BECAUSE OF
THIS, ALL WEBS
MAY BE COMPARED
WITH EACH OTHER
IN TERMS OF
TRUTH.

Davidson’s elevation of
truth along with logic to
solid ground is hardly
surprising, since logic
is the study of the
presentation of the truth.

143

Hard-edged Truth versus Relativism
Davidson embraces Quine’s view that science is underdetermined, but rejects Quine’s totally revisable web. In
its place comes a partially revisable web, hanging
TRAPPED
between a hard core of logic and the hard edges
BETWEEN
THE TWO
of truth. Truth provides a rigid base on which an
OF

FOR APPROXIMATING THE TRUTH, NOR
DOES HE OFFER A JUSTIFICATION FOR

HE FAILED TO CONVINCE
HARDENED RELATIVISTS.

144

Cognitive Science
and Logic
Aside from logic’s importance
to scientific methodology, there
are sciences which make
obvious use of logic and even
aspire to being overtly logical.
Such motivation comes from
computers. Just as you could
talk of computer programs
knowing nothing whatsoever
about the underlying
electronics, so cognitive
science hopes to understand
human consciousness with no
regard to the behaviour of a
system of brain cells of which
we know very little.

IN A COMPUTER, WE
CAN GET AWAY WITH
DISREGARDING THE
ELECTRONICS BECAUSE WE
CONSTRUCTED IT TO BEHAVE AS
A LOGICAL SYSTEM.

THE COMMON
ASSUMPTION OF THE
COGNITIVE SCIENCES IS
THAT THE MIND IS A
SIMILAR LOGICAL
SYSTEM.

Turing was a big supporter of this
assumption. It motivated his
repeated attempts to create the
first digital computers. The boom
of the cognitive sciences is for
the most part due to the success
of Turing’s machines and the rise
of Chomskian linguistics.

145

Chomsky’s Universal Grammar
Noam Chomsky’s (b.1928) interest in linguistics was directed to
a central issue of language learning. At the time, it was thought
that children learn language by imitating adults. Experiments
showed that children can create grammatically correct
sentences that they have never heard. A three-year-old will
correct an adult’s grammar but never argue with them over facts.

Determinator

noun phrase.
TO EXPLAIN THIS,
I SUGGESTED THAT THERE
MUST BE INNATE “UNIVERSAL
GRAMMAR”. EVERY CHILD IS BORN
WITH CERTAIN GRAMMATICAL
RULES HARDWIRED INTO THEIR
BRAINS.

Universal
Grammar

According to Chomsky, this humanly
innate universal grammar is rich enough
to create all human languages. So all
human languages are based on the same
universal structure. The universal
grammar contains several possible
configurations which determine the
grammar of any human language. These
include word order, whether or not the
language has gendered nouns and
verbs, and how it constructs clauses.

147

Noun and Verb
Categories
Our innate grammar divides
words into different systematic
categories. A child is born with
these categories. As it learns the
vocabulary of a language, it also
learns in which category to place
a word. These categories, along
with a few simple rules of syntax,
define how words may be
combined to form sentences. The
two most important categories are
nouns and verbs.

A SENTENCE OF
ANY LANGUAGE MAY BE
DIVIDED INTO NOUN
PHRASES AND VERB PHRASES.
CONSIDER THIS SIMPLE
SENTENCE: “PIGS FLY.” IT
MAY BE DIVIDED AS
FOLLOWS ...

Pigs fly.

Sentence

Noun phrase

Verb phrase

Noun

Verb

Pigs

fly

148

OF COURSE,
THINGS ARE RARELY THIS
SIMPLE. MORE OFTEN THAN
NOT, SENTENCES ARE FAR MORE
COMPLICATED. THE SENTENCES
MAY CONTAIN MORE THAN A NOUN
AND A VERB – FOR EXAMPLE, “PIGS
FLY HOME.”, WHICH CAN BE
ANALYSED AS ...

Pigs fly home.

Sentence

Noun phrase

Chomsky had to account for complex sentences which may be
made up of noun phrases, verb phrases and another sentence.
For example ...
“John thinks that pigs fly.”
This comes out as ...

John thinks that pigs fly.

Recursive Rules of Grammar
The construction rules of universal grammar are recursive. “Recursive”
means the repeated application of a rule, definition or procedure to
successive results. Chomsky believed that this was the only way to
account for sentences of potentially infinite length. But this was not
enough. Language allows for a great
variety of linguistic constructions,
many of which require new
rules of combination.
Eventually, there became
so many added rules
that Chomsky required
an underlying
structure to support
his theory.

WHILE MORE AND
MORE RULES ARE
REQUIRED TO ACCOUNT FOR
THE DIVERSITY OF LANGUAGE, ALL
OF THESE NEW RULES SEEM TO
FOLLOW THE SAME BASIC
RECURSIVE PATTERN.

BY IDENTIFYING
THIS PATTERN, WE CAN
RELATE THEM ALL BACK TO A
SINGLE, EVEN MORE
ABSTRACT GRAMMAR.

151

The X-bar Theory
Chomsky claimed that a simple set of recursive rules can explain
the formation of any grammatical phrase. He gave it the catchy
name “x-bar” theory.
In x-bar theory, x and y stand for grammatical categories. X-bar
and y-bar stand for the corresponding grammatical phrase.
Their simple rule of formation is x-bar=x+y-bar. This is a simple
formula of recursive application.
Let’s take for example the phrase, “the clock in the corner”.

n-bar

n+p-bar

p+n-bar

the clock in

n

the corner

ACCORDING TO
X-BAR THEORY, IT IS
CONSTRUCTED LIKE
THIS ...

key:
n-bar

152

A Logical Theory
Chomsky believed that x-bar theory can explain both the
process of language learning and people’s intuitive grasp of
their native language. Supplemented with an appropriate
mechanism for word order and transformation rules, Chomsky
thought x-bar theory is sufficient to explain all grammatical
constructions in any given language.
X-bar theory is a logical theory because it is concerned with
form rather than content and with the construction of strings of
symbols by successive application of a few simple rules.

I BELIEVE WE ARE
BORN WITH A LANGUAGE
MECHANISM IN THE BRAIN
THAT CAN BE DESCRIBED AS
A LOGICAL PROGRAM.

If Chomsky is right,
then our understanding
of natural language
comes down to a
computation based on
our innate grammar.

Influenced by this idea,
some prominent
philosophers have
proclaimed the brain to
be in part little more than
a complex computer
negotiating language
along Chomskian lines.
153

Problems of Syntax and Semantics
Chomskian linguistics goes some way towards thinking of
natural language in “model-theoretic” terms. Chomsky himself
is more concerned with syntax than semantics, but realizes
that for languages such as English, syntax and semantics
cannot be completely divorced.
Chomsky found that he had to look at the semantics of each
word in order to explain why some sentences that seem to be
syntactically well formed are in fact meaningless. For example:

“I cried
THIS LOOKS LIKE AN
INNOCENT SUBJECT-VERBOBJECT SENTENCE, BUT IT IS
OBVIOUSLY SILLY.

WE CANNOT SAY
THAT THIS FORM OF
SENTENCE IS
UNGRAMMATICAL, AS MOST
SENTENCES OF THIS FORM
ARE PERFECTLY FINE ...
... FOR EXAMPLE,
“I FIRED HER.”

154

her.”
The difference between the grammatically
correct and incorrect sentences must lie
with the meaning of the verb.

FOR THIS REASON,
I INTRODUCED A NUMBER
OF CRITERIA TO DESCRIBE
THE BEHAVIOUR OF
WORDS.
THESE CRITERIA
DETERMINE WHICH WORDS
MAY BE COMBINED TO FORM
SENTENCES IN MORE DETAIL
THAN THE SIMPLE DISTINCTION
BETWEEN NOUN PHRASES
AND VERB PHRASES.

155

Chomsky suggests categories
that describe whether the word
is active or passive; whether it
implies intention and so on. The
rules governing the behaviour of
these categories form part of a
highly intricate semantic model
that is still being refined.

Complex Grammatical
Structures
Chomskian linguistics enjoyed a good deal
of initial success in dealing with structured
languages like English and French. But
within these there are a number of dialects
– e.g., Cockney rhyming slang and Parisian
back slang – and additionally a large
number of regional accents. Chomskian
linguistics aspires to explain them all. To do
this, it has been forced to add progressively
more layers of grammatical structure.

Deep grammar
(x-bar theory)

A SIMPLE
HIERARCHY WOULD
LOOK A BIT LIKE
THIS ...

Phonological form
(issues of pronunciation)

Surface grammar
(word order, etc.)

Logical form
(semantic issues
reflected in grammar,
e.g., “I fired her” is
grammatically
correct but “I cried
her” is not)

Each stage of Chomsky’s hierarchy contains a huge
amount of information and its own set of recursive rules.
This structure runs along with other complex structures,
like the vocabulary of the language and word
morphology – the structure of the words themselves.

Vocabulary
Morphology

So large is the amount of information involved that it
seems improbable that human evolution could have
generated such a complex structure. This suggests the
question of whether there is enough space or structure
in the newborn’s brain to contain all this information.
157

Problems with “Universal” Grammar
The assumption of universal grammar is further shaken when we
move to examine languages other than the Western European
ones, e.g., Slavonic, Semitic and aboriginal languages. In these
languages, word order is of very little importance. While some
meaningful structures are more common than others, very few
are actually ungrammatical.

SOME OF US
UNDERSTAND TIME TO BE
CYCLICAL, WHICH EXPLAINS THE
RELATIVE LACK OF TENSING IN
OUR LANGUAGE.

158

OTHERS HAVE NO
ABSTRACT NOUNS. OUR
LANGUAGE SIMPLY MISSES OUT
A CATEGORY OF WORDS THAT
YOU TAKE TO BE INNATE.

The absence of abstract nouns in actual
languages proves that languages can exist
without them, which in turn casts doubt on
whether we are all born with an innate
grasp of them.

DESPITE THIS, WE
STILL NEED SOME
ACCOUNT OF THE SPEED AND
ACCURACY WITH WHICH WE
LEARN LANGUAGES. A FINITE SET
OF AXIOMS IS A GOOD WAY
TO ACCOUNT FOR THIS.

It must be remembered that generative
linguistics is a relatively new science,
so it is hardly surprising that theories
must evolve to account for difficult
cases. It is just that at present we have
no better explanation.
159

The Symbolic Brain Model
Inspired by the success of Chomskian linguistics, many
philosophers and psychologists aspire to explain all human
mental life the way Chomsky tried to explain language. They
conceive of the mind as the result of an immense number of
logical manipulations in the brain. This program roughly divides
into two camps, each employing two different logical systems.
We can think of these as two models: the I-Robot and Y-Robot.
THE FIRST OR
“SYMBOLIC” APPROACH
TAKES THE BRAIN TO BE A
MACHINE THAT MANIPULATES
SYMBOLS.
BEING IN VARIOUS
MENTAL STATES IS
EQUIVALENT TO ARRIVING AT A
WELL-FORMED FORMULA IN A
FORMAL LANGUAGE.
BEING IN
EXCRUCIATING PAIN, FOR
EXAMPLE, AMOUNTS TO A
PARTICULAR COMBINATION OF
SYMBOLS IN THE BRAIN’S
PAIN CENTRES.

AAIIIEEEOUCH!!!

160

A MORE RECENT
IDEA IS TO THINK OF THE
BRAIN AS A MECHANISM THAT
EMPLOYS FUZZY LOGIC. IT
CONCEIVES OF THE BRAIN AS A
“NEURAL NET” WHICH CAN BE
IN ANY OF A VARIETY OF
STATES.

A neural net is composed of units which behave like brain cells
(neurones). Like a neurone, they are connected to multiple inputs
and multiple outputs. The response is governed by the overall
effect of the input received. The process of computation that goes
on within the net is not akin to a formal deduction. The only way
we have of modelling this
behaviour is statistical,
and as such we know
very little about a
particular net.
A simple neural net looks
like this ...

161

Training a Neural Net
Suppose we train a neural net to produce “spoken” English
words correctly from text. The input would be letters and the
output would be sound. The “neurones” have to learn to relate
the two correctly. The system learns by attaching different levels
of importance to different inputs and outputs. This is
done by multiplying each of the connections
(represented by lines in the diagram) by a
different number.

H
E
L
L
O

Initially, the connections are given small random
numbers. Then the results that the net gives are
corrected and a different weighting is tried. The
machine will continue to alter the weighting whilst
producing statistically improved results.

162

NEURAL NETS ARE
A BASIC APPLICATION
OF THE IDEAS OF FUZZY
LOGIC.

Hello

First, nets are connected to various
outputs and there are various situations
that will make them fire. This contrasts
with the behaviour of a vending machine
which is based on propositional calculus
and only ever has one output for each
state. Second, the different weightings
given to the different connections are a
numerical equivalent to the multiple truth
values of fuzzy logic.
163

Pattern Recognition
Compared to digital computers, neural nets are particularly good
at pattern recognition. This leads them to excel at producing
word sounds from text where a conventional computer would
flounder. There is no problem in getting a neural net to recognize
a piece of music ...

THIS IS MOZART.

... but it probably
could not tell you
what the notes are.

164

A digital computer
could recognize the
notes easily, but it is
very hard to get it to
recognize the style.

The human brain seems to behave in a
similar way. Humans find it very easy to
categorize things but spend many years
learning how to do mathematics.

THESE CONSIDERATIONS
HAVE LED SOME TO THINK THAT
THE MIND IS SIMPLY A
CONSEQUENCE OF THE
COMPLICATED NEURAL NET THAT
IS THE HUMAN BRAIN.

3?
7?
5?

65?
44?

22?

This means that neural
nets are very bad at
things like maths, logical
reasoning and learning
to obey linguistic syntax.

NEURAL NETS FIND
THE SYSTEMATIC
MANIPULATION OF
SYMBOLS VERY HARD.

165

The Rational Behaviour Model
The dominant assumption about the mind is that we should think
of it as a model involved in generating rational behaviour.
According to this theory, one of the main features of the
conscious mind is to act for a
reason. Certain cognitive
psychologists believe that this
is made possible by a model
of rational action built into the
human brain. It is claimed that
we make sense of our own
psychological behaviour and
the behaviour of others by
means of this model. It is
based on Aristotle’s notion of
the practical syllogism ...

MY LOGICAL
SYLLOGISMS WERE
CONCERNED WITH VALID
FORMS OF ARGUMENT
WHICH ARRIVE AT VALID
CONCLUSIONS.

THE PRACTICAL
SYLLOGISMS ARRIVE
AT VALID REASONS FOR
ACTION.

166

Practical Reason
In a practical syllogism, the first premise is a statement of desire,
e.g., “I want to eat.”
The second premise is a statement of belief,
e.g., “There is food in my fridge.”
These lead to a conclusion that recommends a course of action
– “I should go to the fridge.”

MANY COGNITIVE
PSYCHOLOGISTS
BELIEVE THAT OUR MIND IS
EQUIPPED WITH A PICTURE
OF THE WORLD CONTAINING
MANY THINGS THAT WE
TAKE TO BE TRUE.

167

It is also maintained that we
contain some sort of
“deliberation mechanism” that
extracts goals from needs.
These are then combined with
the world picture to give
reasons for action. This is
called the “belief/desire”
model.

What is Consciousness?
Although most cognitive psychologists and philosophers of
mind hold this “practical” view, there is still much unresolved
disagreement.

ARE SUCH
MODELS ACTUALLY IN
THE BRAIN?
OR ARE THEY A
SIMPLIFICATION OF A
MUCH MORE
COMPLICATED
MECHANISM?

OR IS IT JUST A
GOOD METHOD OF
MODELLING HUMAN
BEHAVIOUR REGARDLESS
OF HOW THE BRAIN
WORKS?

Whatever the differences, the fact remains that they all see
the brain as a machine that follows rules of rational thinking.
Our conscious life is the result of electro-chemical reactions
in the brain that instantiate an immensely complex logical
manipulation machine. Whether this is convincing or not, a lot
of effort is going into cracking the computer program that is
human consciousness.

168

The Place of Logic
Logic gets into all forms of human inquiry.
All good arguments should be logical, so
they must follow logical rules to show that
the conclusions follow from the premises.
Logic itself makes very few claims about
anything. It is a tool, a method of analysis.
SO LOGIC DOES
NOT DICTATE THAT THE
GOOD OF THE MANY
OUTWEIGHS THE GOOD
OF THE FEW?

NO, LOGIC CANNOT
MAKE SUCH CLAIMS. BUT IT
DOES PROVIDE YOU WITH A
WAY OF REACHING THAT
CONCLUSION FROM CERTAIN
PREMISES.

Logic can be used
for more than that.
The emphasis that
modern logic puts on
syntactic rules allows
us to use it for
everything from
digital electronics to
analysing language.

169

Wittgenstein’s Change of View
Logic seems an inseparable part of our lives. But not everyone is
convinced that logic is so vital. In his later period, Wittgenstein
moved away from the faith in logic he held as a young man. In a
famous dialogue with Turing, he was keen to press the practical
consequences over theoretical worries. With scepticism about
the role of logic came a new view of philosophy.

WITTGENSTEIN
CAME TO THINK THAT
WHAT WAS IMPORTANT IN
PHILOSOPHY WAS NOT
ARGUMENT BUT GETTING
PEOPLE TO SEE THINGS
FROM A NEW
PERSPECTIVE.

WORK ON
PHILOSOPHY IS – AS
WORK IN ARCHITECTURE
FREQUENTLY IS – ACTUALLY
MORE A KIND OF WORK ON
ONESELF. ON ONE’S OWN
CONCEPTION. ON THE
WAY ONE SEES
THINGS.

170

If someone believes that he has found the solution to the
“problem of life”… then in order to refute himself, he would only
have to remember that there was a time when this “solution” had
not been found; but at that time too one had to be able to live …

AND THAT IS
WHAT HAPPENS TO
US IN LOGIC.

IF THERE WERE A
“SOLUTION” TO LOGICAL
PROBLEMS, THEN WE WOULD
ONLY HAVE TO CALL TO MIND THAT
AT ONE TIME THEY HAD NOT BEEN
SOLVED (AND THEN TOO ONE HAD
TO BE ABLE TO LIVE AND
THINK).

171

Perhaps unsurprisingly, coming at the end of a century in
which logic has enjoyed such tangible success, very few are
prepared to follow Wittgenstein in his line of thought. Instead,
logic continues to play a part in forming the foundation of
Western science, mathematics and technology.

SO WHAT DO
YOU THINK, SPOCK?
NEAT LITTLE TRICK,
ISN’T IT?

THE WHOLE
OF WESTERN
CIVILIZATION HAS
MADE A GREAT DEAL
OUT OF YOUR
“LITTLE TRICK”.

172

WHETHER IT BELONGS TO
THE ESSENCE OF THOUGHT AND
LANGUAGE OR NOT, THE ABILITY TO THINK
SYSTEMATICALLY AND TO PROVE THAT YOU
ARE THINKING IN STEPS THAT FOLLOW ONE
FROM THE OTHER, TURNS OUT TO BE A
FORMAL ADVANTAGE WHEN APPLIED TO
A GREAT VARIETY OF CONTENTS.
